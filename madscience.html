                    <p class=" m-0">In all generations, there have been daring scientists who have pushed boundaries and
                      achieved great breakthroughs. While many of these scientists have been called geniuses in history,
                      others have been called mad. Whether in fiction or in real life, scientists have endeavored
                      towards achieving new discoveries. It is different matter that not all of these discoveries have
                      worked or seem logical. When it comes to real-life scientists, eccentricity and brilliance seem to
                      go hand in hand. History has witnessed some of the greatest scientists who can be considered as
                      mad. One of the real-life scientists who earned the reputation of a mad scientist during his time
                      was the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. He is majorly known for his contributions in
                      inventing the AC generator and the wireless radio. Tesla’s name often conjures an image of a man
                      pulling down a giant electric switch in a shower of fiery sparks. Tesla also loved putting on a
                      good show for his audience, often using his own body as a conductor during public demonstrations.
                      Richard Feynman is another person who earned the reputation of a mad scientist. He was one of the
                      scientists in the US government’s Manhattan Project that was responsible for developing the atomic
                      bomb. Feynman was a free-spirited man, who explored music and nature, decoded Mayan hieroglyphics,
                      and picked locks in his spare time. Another mad scientist in history was Sidney Gottlieb. He was
                      an American chemist with knowledge in knowledge, and headed the US Central Intelligence Agency’s
                      technical services division. Gottlieb was a master of poisons and believed that influencing and
                      controlling the human mind could help the US in attaining global dominance. Gottlieb hatched
                      schemes of assassinating Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro by poisoning his cigar. Another
                      person who can be considered as a mad scientist is Dr. Robert J. White. He was an American
                      neurosurgeon best known as the first to successfully remove the brain of a living dog and keeping
                      it alive outside the body. A few years later, White transplanted a canine brain into another dog’s
                      neck, thus surgically providing the dog with two brains. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p class=" m-0">Scientists who are ahead of their time are often neglected, scorned, or even
                      ridiculed by society. However, many of these daring inventors have made such remarkable scientific
                      breakthroughs that have profoundly shaped the future of mankind and significantly transformed the
                      modern world. When one looks at innovations, such as the electric light bulb, airplanes,
                      telephone, television, and more recent personal computers, which were savagely mocked when they
                      first came out, one is reminded of the importance of supporting the crazy inventors. Breakthrough
                      inventions take time, effort, and patience to come to fruition. Inventors generally have excessive
                      confidence in their ideas, but many a times these ideas do not translate into effective designs in
                      one go. A sustained financial support, possibly unconditional and benevolent from public-spirited
                      funders, can help innovators in improvising on their prototype and adding new functionalities and
                      features to it. In addition, innovations can be encouraged by providing tax relief to inventors
                      for setting up research and development labs. Moreover, stories of successful innovators should be
                      included in textbooks for inspiring and igniting the mind of young aspiring inventors. It is very
                      possible that several of the ideas presented by inventors may appear to be irrational, unviable,
                      whimsical, or even socially undesirable. Equal space should be provided for inventors to nurture
                      rational as well as irrational ideas for fueling the human spirit to achieve the unthinkable.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p class="m-0">The climate crisis is an increasingly pressing issue that has been garnering
                      considerable attention across various economies in the world. Some of the major issues that have
                      been looming in the economy in the past few years are rising global temperatures, exhausting
                      natural
                      resources, intense floods, hurricanes, fires, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following
                      are some of the weird but interesting inventions that are likely to provide some hope during
                      tiring
                      times.</p>

                    <ul>

                      <li><strong> Giant Vacuum Cleaner for Smog -</strong> SMOG FREE PROJECT is a campaign initiated by
                        Daan Roosegaarde for promoting clean air. SMOG FREE TOWER, a giant vacuum cleaner for smog, is
                        incorporated with eco-friendly technology for cleaning 30.000m3 on an hourly basis. The tower
                        which is capable of sucking up all the pollution from the air utilizes a very little amount of
                        green electricity. </li>
                      <li><strong> Floating Nets to Clear Ocean Plastic -</strong> The Ocean Cleanup project that was
                        initiated in the year 2012 by Boyan Slat is involved in picking up and eliminating all the
                        plastic
                        present in the rivers and oceans with the help of gigantic floating nets. All the plastics
                        removed
                        are converted into maintainable products and all the earnings are reinvested back into cleaning
                        up
                        the plastic. </li>
                      <li><strong> Paper Made From Stone - </strong>The world pulp and paper sector claim a share of
                        nearly 40% in the overall industrial logging. As a measure to deal with the issue of
                        deforestation, Karst manufactures paper without using any chlorine, acids, water, or timber, and
                        utilizes only a third of the carbon footprint. Karst replaces trees with stones by transforming
                        recycled stones into minimal, beautiful, and functional products that are largely strong as well
                        as brighter in comparison to conventional paper.</li>
                      <li><strong> Lamp Powered by Saltwater -</strong> Sustainable Alternative Lighting geddit (SALt)
                        is
                        a lamp that works entirely with the help of water and salt. Initially developed for helping the
                        isolated Philippine islands where access to electricity is unusual, SALt comes equipped with USB
                        ports for charging phones, and makes use of saline water for powering LED lights.</li>
                      <li><strong> Forest Made of Data -</strong> Big data today is a large business, and the rapidly
                        growing demand for this is impacting the world. Huge data farms account for a major share of
                        land
                        and consumer large quantities of electricity. World data centers are estimated to make use of
                        over
                        25% of world energy in the near future. Grow Your Own Cloud, is a novel biotech company that
                        addresses this issue by enabling the storage of data in plant's DNA. This new storage medium is
                        capable of storing all the data in the world in merely 1kg of DNA.</li>
                      <li><strong> Magic Straw to Filter Dirty H2O into Drinking Water -</strong> LifeStraw is capable
                        of
                        filtering all types of microbiological contaminants that deteriorate the quality of water and
                        make
                        it non-drinkable. Every single LifeStraw can convert nearly 4,000 liters of polluted water into
                        drinkable water. This has rapidly increased access to clean and drinkable water for several
                        people
                        around the world.</li>
                      <li><strong> Solar & Pedal Powered Sound Systems -</strong> The Solar Sound System developed in
                        Hong
                        Kong is a strong and mobile sound system that has superior sound quality for any event. The
                        system
                        needs only pedal power and spot of sun for being functional, comes with turntables for DJs, and
                        offers a sound system for events including 50-500 individuals.</li>
                      <li><strong> Concrete Made with CO2 -</strong> Every 1kg of cement manufactured releases over
                        0.5kg
                        of carbon dioxide into the air. This causes nearly 5% of world CO2 emissions. The cement blocks
                        manufactured by Solidia Technologies, on the other hand, can suck CO2 from the air during the
                        manufacturing process.</li>
                      <li><strong> Plastic Alternative from Methane -</strong> Mango material creates a naturally
                        happening biopolymer from waste biogas, methane, which is cheaper in comparison to traditional
                        oil-based plastics. Transforming greenhouse gas into something that can replace plastic proves
                        to
                        be very useful for our planet, Earth.</li>
                      <li><strong> Stationery That Can Be Planted -</strong> Each year, nearly eighty thousand trees are
                        chopped for meeting the world demand for 14 billion pencils. The left-hand design has developed
                        a
                        substitute line of notebooks and pencils that can be reused for a second time. All the
                        stationary,
                        notebooks, pencils, greeting cards, and red envelopes are overloaded with seeds, where once they
                        are completely used for their first job they can be popped into the soil and can be grown into
                        vegetables and herbs. </li>
                      <li><strong> Edible Cutlery -</strong> Bakeys manufactures edible cutlery that is free from any
                        milk
                        products, preservatives, and chemicals. It also sells every set at a cost that is similar to
                        plastic cutlery. </li>
                      <li><strong> Plastic Bottle Air-Conditioning-</strong> With temperatures across the world soaring
                        rapidly, air-conditioning becomes very essential for individuals. The EcoCoolers is a unique DIY
                        cooling system that needs no electricity and works only on plastic soda bottles.</li>
                      <li><strong> Lights Powered by Algae -</strong> Single-cell microalgae is a plant that has the
                        probability of cleaning the air, light city streets, and fuel cars. The plant is completely
                        self-reliant developing all the energy needed via photosynthesis during the day, besides it can
                        also absorb CO2.</li>
                      <li><strong> Ashtrays from Discarded Butts -</strong> Smoking is harmful not only to an
                        individual’s
                        health but also to the environment as cigarette butts are found in large quantities in the
                        trash.
                        The ashtray developed by PuriFungi is very unique as the tray is manufactured using butts that
                        are
                        transformed by fungi via a biological method of mycoremediation.</li>
                      <li><strong> Sustainable Tent -</strong> Largely developed for refugees, Weaving a Home, is a tent
                        that offers appropriate collapsible shelter, and stores rainwater and solar energy. The tent
                        helps
                        in transforming the lives of refugees by offering humanity and stability to them.</li>
                      <li><strong> Vegan Leather -</strong> Many vegan leather substitutes are developed from plastics,
                        and as suchthey are good for animals but are not for the environment. Desserto is plant-based
                        leather that is developed from cactus, is breathable, and is largely durable. Cactus need less
                        water, can absorb CO2, and mature portions of the plant can be harvested instead of the complete
                        plant.</li>
                      <li><strong> Beer Made from Bread -</strong> Crust deciphered a way of transforming fresh
                        excessive
                        quantities of bread, available in major hotels and top bakeries that are otherwise discarded,
                        into
                        craft beer.</li>
                      <li><strong> Textile Dyes Natural Way -</strong> One of the major issues that are affecting the
                        water quality of the Asian economy is the chemical pollution that is being caused by the textile
                        sector. Cleaner and greener ways of treating textile dyes are chemical intensive and water
                        intensive. Colorfix makes use of biologically and nature-driven methods for making dyes that
                        utilize lesser chemicals, water, and energy.</li>
                      <li><strong> Ecocrete Tiles and Planters-Made from Recycled Plastic -</strong> Slab interiors are
                        being used in Bali for dealing with plastic pollution that can otherwise choke waterways and
                        upcycle into concrete home interiors. Any type of plastic that can be ragged is utilized and a
                        normal planter consists of nearly 120 bottles.</li>

                      crucial
                      and useful inventions include</p>
                    <br />

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Refrigeration - </strong>The first refrigeration machine was developed in the year 1755 by a
                        Scotland-based professor, William Cullen. The refrigeration was designed with a pump for
                        creating
                        an incomplete vacuum over a diethyl ether container, which absorbs heat from the nearby air on
                        boiling. However, the first refrigeration machine that made use of vapor and not liquid for
                        cooling was developed in the year 1805 by Cullen. The first refrigeration machine that was
                        developed for practical refrigeration was designed in 1834 by Jacob Parkins, and he was the
                        first
                        person to hold a patent for his invention.</li>
                      <li><strong>Toothbrush -</strong> Prior to the invention of toothbrushes, people made use of chew sticks, and twigs
                        with tattered ends for brushing their teeth. The chew sticks were used for rubbing against and
                        cleaning the teeth. Bristle toothbrushes very much similar to the present ones were invented in
                        China in the year 1498. Bristles back then were very rigid, and uneven hairs were taken from
                        behind the hog’s neck and hooked onto the handles that were made of bamboo or bone. Until 1938,
                        boar bristles were only used and the nylon bristles were launched in the same year by Dupont de
                        Nemours. The first nylon toothbrush that was launched was named Doctor West`s Miracle
                        Toothbrush.
                        Subsequently, impressed by the oral hygiene habits of the soldiers from world war II,
                        individuals
                        increasingly adopted nylon toothbrushes for maintaining good oral hygiene.</li>
                      <li><strong>Three-Position Traffic Lights -</strong> The first-ever traffic signal was invented in London in the
                        year
                        1868, however, the contemporary traffic signal was launched by a policeman from Detroit, William
                        Potts. This traffic light was developed using a few switches and wires, and 3 colors of railroad
                        lights and was popularly used for controlling traffic at Michigan and at the corner of Woodward.
                        However, the system was patented by Garret Morgan in 1923, which was soon bought by General
                        Electric (GE), and since then the company was developing as well as marketing traffic signals to
                        the national market.</li>
                      <li><strong>Air Conditioner -</strong> Air conditioner was invented by Willis Carrier in the year 1902. He was the
                        first person to invent a method for controlling humidity, which is the basic building block for
                        contemporary air conditioners. Carrier’s invention gave birth to several industries that rule
                        the
                        economy today. Production of several things ranging from baked goods to wartime essentials was
                        also produced thanks to the air conditioning. The accurate control of humidity and temperature
                        provided by the air conditioners made it very popular for use in cinema theaters, transatlantic
                        flights, servers, computer rooms, and shopping malls also.</li>
                      <li><strong>Syringe -</strong> Syringes were initially used by Romans, however, the first contemporary version was
                        launched in 1650, when Blaise Pascal was experimenting with hydrodynamics. The device developed
                        by
                        Pascal demonstrated the law of physics which came to be known as Pascal’s laws. As per the law
                        whenever there is a rise in pressure at a given point in a limited liquid, there is an equal
                        rise
                        at every other point in the vessel. The first hollow steel needle was invented by Francis Rynd
                        in
                        1844 for injecting medicine, while the first hypodermic needle was invented in 1853.</li>
                      <li><strong>Zipper -</strong> Elias Howe was the person behind who invented of the sewing machine and in 1851, he
                        received a patent for "Automatic, Continuous Clothing Closure". Moving forward, Whitcomb Judson
                        marketed the "Clasp Locker" device in 1893 that was similar to Howe’s model but he was the first
                        one to market as is hence called the "inventor of the zipper," however, the term zipper was used
                        majorly until B. F. Goodrich Company started using this term. Gideon Sundback launched a novel
                        and
                        improved system Separable Fastener in 1917.</li>
                      <li><strong>Head Phones - </strong>The first headphones were invented by Nathaniel Baldwin in 1910. Baldwin
                        utilized
                        the idea for a telephonic feature for developing an even more subtle telephonic receiver in 1910
                        and subsequently retailed the versions to the US Navy on a contract basis. The headphones sent
                        by
                        Baldwin were found to be highly useful and practicable in comparison to the model that was used
                        by
                        Naval radio operators at that time. Later on, Wireless Specialty Apparatus Co. partnered with
                        Baldwin for manufacturing headphones. The first marketable and viable stereo headphones were
                        launched in 1957 by EMI.</li>
                      <li><strong>Single-Handle Sink Faucet - </strong>Faucets were initially used by Romans during 1000 B.C. However,
                        during the 20th-century individuals deciphered that hot water and cold water both could be
                        blended
                        into a single fixture. Alfred Moen in the year 1937 invented the first single-handle faucet that
                        was capable of blending hot as well as cold water prior to leaving the fixture or pipe. </li>
                      <li><strong>Mason Jars - </strong>John L. Mason invented the mason jars that are used even today in the year 1858.
                        The machine was invented that was capable of cutting threads into lids, which made it possible
                        for
                        manufacturing a jar with recyclable and screw-on lids. The sealing mechanism was the biggest
                        difference between the jars invented by Mason and the previous jars. A glass container was
                        developed with a thread that was molded into its top part and a lid made of zinc was designed
                        with
                        a rubber ring. The seal created by the rubber was maintained by the threaded lid. These jars
                        were
                        popularly used for home storage of various things such as tomatoes, pickles, and relishes. </li>
                      <li><strong>Allen Wrench/Hex Key - </strong>The concept of cold-forming screw heads around a hexagonal die was
                        patented by William G. Aller in 1910. The Allen manufacturing company was the first company to
                        launch a hex socket drive in the market.</li>
                      <li><strong>Flat Bottomed Paper Bags -</strong> Margaret Knight was the first woman to receive a patent for
                        developing a machine that was capable of creating flat-bottomed paper bags in the year 1871.
                        Subsequent to making the machine, she developed the Easter Paper Bag Company. The initial paper
                        bag was however invented in 1852 by Francis Wolle. </li>
                      <li><strong>Vaccinations - </strong> Edward Jenner made use of cowpox material for developing immunity to smallpox.
                        The method developed by him underwent major technological and medical alterations and led to the
                        elimination of smallpox eventually. This was considered the first vaccine in the world. The
                        rabies
                        vaccine developed by Louis Pasteur in 1885 was the next vaccine that made a great impact on
                        human
                        diseases. Subsequently, vaccines and antitoxins against tuberculosis, typhoid, plague, cholera,
                        anthrax, tetanus, and diphtheria were developed through the 1930s.</li>
