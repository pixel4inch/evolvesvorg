                  <p class=" m-0"> All businesses, both large and small, impact the society in different ways. It is
                    important for the businesses to wield a positive effect on the society. Philanthropic social
                    responsibilities aim at bettering the society through active involvement and go beyond the ethical
                    operations. Charity plays a key role in this as it helps relieve problems by directing conscious and
                    subconscious energies towards the deserving. The efforts of NGOs, non-profits, and charitable
                    organizations go a long way in providing food, shelter, clothing, and education for poor children,
                    the homeless, and the abandoned. While the morale good in charitable giving is well known, the
                    competitive advantage of the same for companies needs more awareness and this is highlighted by the
                    fact that corporate philanthropy is on the decline. Charitable contributions by U.S. companies over
                    the last 15 years declined as a percentage of profits by over 50%. </p>
                    <br/>

                  <p class=" m-0">The pressure to maximize short-term profits for investors has overshadowed charitable
                    giving’s real impact on bottom-line benefits. Regulatory demands for higher levels of “corporate
                    social responsibility” is also resulting in “strategic philanthropy”, which far from being real
                    philanthropy is just a form of advertising promoting a company’s social image through high-profile
                    sponsorships. What fails to be seen here is that the combined social and economic benefits of pure
                    philanthropy can benefit a company in more ways than one. Pure corporate philanthropy helps in
                    boosting morale; create goodwill among the community;
                    Builds camaraderie among employees, brings out real social change in local communities, offers tax
                    benefits; helps attract and retaining good employees and indirectly helps build strong brand equity
                    in the market. Philanthropy is a cost-effective way and also the only certain way to improve
                    competitiveness in an ecosystem as it allows companies to leverage not only their own resources but
                    also the resources of the community and infrastructure of nonprofits and other institutions.
                    Donations to a university, for example, is a less expensive way to strengthen a local skill
                    development which can help alleviate the skill shortage and the expenses for the company associated
                    with the need for developing and training skills in-house.

                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">The high watermark in 2022 is the return of strategic thinking in charities by
                    leveraging the knowledge base accumulated over the previous years and digital ways to gain maximum
                    usage. Compared to earlier years, in 2022, charities experienced a certain degree of stability.
                    However, with new challenges cropping up, charities must explore new solutions to overcome all such
                    challenges.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Based on past lessons, in 2023, the fundraising trends consider the in-person events
                    again, meeting the present challenges, such as the cost-of-living crisis, thus accommodating the
                    need for considering income diversity. Furthermore, many of the recent fundraising trends are
                    forward-looking, with a continued prevalence of gaming yielding good results and the rising
                    necessity for flexible output. A few trends are crucial in 2023 that can define the future success
                    of fundraising.</p>
<br/>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Income-Stream Significance: </strong>The crisis concerning the cost of living refers to the decrease in
                      real disposable income, driven by the energy crisis, labor shortage, the trailing effects of the
                      COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine war, and many other factors. Such a crisis for cost-of-living will
                      likely remain for some time, with inflation reaching a high very soon. The increased prices of
                      energy, fuel, and many more things are expected to adversely affect the charity sector. In 2023,
                      income diversity is expected to remain a prominent trend, which mandates charities to explore
                      newer means of raising funds without relying on tested and tried channels. Besides, charities must
                      increase the sources of income, as adequacy in income streams implies that even with the primary
                      income source vanishing or diminishing, the charity can perform its operations and meet the
                      service demanded by users. The crisis related to the cost of giving demonstrates the significance
                      of income diversity since one income source can start waning for several charities. Thus,
                      charities must assess their prevailing income sources, consider the risk concerning each stream,
                      and broadly identify the diversity need. If the requirement is for urgent diversification, the
                      availability of several income sources can prove helpful to fundraising. Examples of a few
                      fundraising sources are micro-financing and crowdfunding, CSR and corporate partnerships, selling
                      merchandise or many more products, tribute and legacy fundraising, and sponsorship models, among
                      others. Based on the resources and expertise the charities have, every possible income source is
                      essential to consider, and the most lucrative one is preferable to pick up.</li>
                    <li><strong>In-Person Events Becoming Popular Again:</strong> Despite the possibility of COVID-19 hanging at the
                      start of the year, with several charities practicing caution and playing safe, preferring video
                      streaming to hybrid or physical, the physical events are again gaining prominence in 2023. Myriad
                      benefits remain associated with in-person events, allowing improved socializing and networking.
                      Being able to read the body language concerning a person vastly enhances the social connection,
                      particularly compared with the virtual. Additionally, the in-person event builds transparency and
                      trust since in-person communication tries to foster a long-lasting relationship. Besides, such
                      events allow audiences to engage better with content. All such benefits remain crucial and
                      demonstrate why charities embrace in-person events again.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Events Continue to Prevail:</strong> Learning from their experience, successful charities can
                      embrace digital to leverage the most of the prevailing situation and move forward to the future
                      seamlessly. In-person events with few hybrid options continue to find preference. In 2022, the
                      physical events again started gaining normalcy, allowing occasional handshakes, including
                      in-person talks. Besides, the prevalence of digital media continues, indicating that several
                      future charity operations, post-COVID-19, would continue to embrace hybrid events. Before the
                      occurrence of COVID-19, virtual events picked popularity. However, charities remained relatively
                      sluggish in embracing such events during such a period but became a popular choice for charities
                      since the arrival of the outbreak, resulting in immediate benefits.

                      <br /><br />

                      Such benefits concerning virtual events are overcoming geographical barriers, effortless access
                      leading to easy reach, restricting travel and other costs, and amplifying more comfortable voices
                      over screens. However, virtual events also have drawbacks, specifically concerning building
                      relationships and authenticity. However, after the return of physical events in 2022, charities
                      are witnessing benefits from hybrid events combining both virtual and physical forms. Besides,
                      such events are relatively cost-effective and uncomplicated. All charities can telecast physical
                      events, allowing people to enjoy them remotely, including all other positive happenings,
                      supporting effortless interactions. Hybrid charities offer the best combination concerning
                      physical and virtual forms, ensuring authenticity and promoting additional reach, overcoming
                      geographical barriers while extending an earmarked geographical area, enhancing ROI, and many
                      more.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Gaming Gains Strength:</strong> Even though gaming started gaining popularity in 2021, yielding good
                      results, it flourished in 2022 and is growing further. Gaming for Good is excellent for
                      fundraising and is yet to get embraced by several charities, and it has the potential to raise
                      necessary funds while the situation is tough. As a new fundraising avenue, charities hope to add
                      it to diversify their fundraising sources. Gaming for good remains a simple and fun way to raise
                      money. Charities must review their consoles, identify the best platforms, and begin a fruitful
                      gaming journey.</li>
                    <li><strong>More Donations Possibilities with Flexible Giving:</strong> Flexible giving allows people to choose
                      their donation amount freely based on individual circumstances. In present-day uncertainty,
                      flexible giving remains essential. The crisis concerning the cost of giving can demotivate several
                      people from donating. It is due to the need for prioritization of essentials needed every day.
                      Moreover, after the economy starts picking up, such people can choose against donating again, as
                      they can forget. Space freed up by flexible giving can minimize donations in hard times and
                      maximize the same while such a period gets better. With the fluctuating disposable income, the
                      ability of people to donate also vacillates. Thus, facilitating people with pragmatic digital
                      solutions can help to alter the monthly donation amount effortlessly concerning charities and
                      allow more donations in the forthcoming period. Charities must allow donors options for flexible
                      donations. Individual charities come with several ways for flexible giving, including permitting
                      the donors to revise the repeated donation rate regularly, usage of digital payment methods for
                      effortless changes, or working with many applications. Thus, flexible giving is turning out as a
                      crucial mode for the future, and it is essential to embrace it early.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crucial Role of Social Media to Increase Reach:</strong> Since the pandemic outbreak, social media
                      experiencing significant importance and is continuing its domination in marketing activities. For
                      charities in recent years, prioritizing socials, irrespective of structures and sizes, remain
                      essential to meet followers effortlessly in their locations. All charities can improve their
                      protocols for social media, enhance social output, gain experience in the appropriate meme time,
                      and preferably create a strategy concerning social media.

                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Prioritizing the social media platforms and suiting the needs of a charity is crucial, rather than
                      adopting any model and making efforts to post on every media platform having inadequate
                      personalization, appreciating and targeting changing demography. Irrespective of their size and
                      shape, it is crucial for charities to participate in a social media platform. However, it is
                      essential to choose an appropriate social media for which consideration of the preferred group for
                      engagement is critical. Besides, a charity must also consider the relevant demographics they want
                      to access and the people they need to turn into donors.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Keeping Up with Changing Trends in Classic Platforms:</strong> Classic Platforms, including Instagram,
                      Facebook, Twitter, and more, predominantly remained preferable to most charities, proving
                      effective and making sense. However, several charities find difficulties adapting to frequent
                      changes concerning the platform functionalities. Successful charities can keep abreast of trends,
                      leverage the power of the newly introduced functionalities, and learn ways to stream live events
                      on Instagram. Fundraising utilizing Stories on Facebook and leveraging Spaces on Twitter while
                      using all new functionalities immediately on arrival can be an excellent way to become successful
                      for charities. For engaging with younger demographics, TikTok offers an ideal opportunity.
                      Besides, TikTok provides a space for increased user-generated content, allowing charities to
                      propose their audience for sharing content, avoiding hierarchy, and embracing a community sense.
                      The British Red Cross used TikTok successfully, taking advantage of sticker donations and
                      involving young supporters while the pandemic prevailed. The TikTok profile of the charity grew to
                      several thousand followers, establishing that community-focused, user-generated content can boost
                      fundraising prolifically.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Power of E-Mail Marketing:</strong> Email marketing contributes significantly towards fundraising
                      revenue online and organizations remain more assured of more click-through rates in an email
                      campaign than Twitter. Several marketers consider that email can produce substantial ROI. Thus,
                      emails remain essential for charities to create excellent opportunities, specifically concerning
                      fundraising. Charities can use robust email marketing campaigns to optimally appeal to several
                      potential donors very quickly and without adequate preparation. Email marketing has immense
                      potential. To leverage its considerable potential, charities must utilize powerful email marketing
                      software. Appropriate email marketing software has several benefits, such as improved performance,
                      better campaign management, accurate targeting, and more. Besides, email marketing software is
                      affordable. As email marketing remains a preferable marketing strategy in 2023, charities must
                      invest in such an effective tool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization of Emerging Platforms:</strong> Extensive efforts can help to discover emerging
                      platforms. Among the emerging social media platforms, only a few find consideration as serious
                      contenders. It is not uncommon to see the emergence of a new platform and its quick rise to
                      enormous popularity and ultimately waning its coveted place. A charity can seek a platform
                      matching its vision, needs, and mission, working best for the charity, allowing it to reach its
                      preferred audience, and helping in effective fundraising. Intensive efforts to explore the
                      platform that will be the best fit for charity are essential. Besides, experimenting on such a
                      platform, observing whether the content introduced on it is working, noting its traction,
                      monitoring crucial metrics, and continuous exploration of success are essential to define the
                      effectiveness of a platform. The gathered data can help to decide the appropriateness of the
                      social media platform for the charity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keeping Watch on Clubhouse: </strong>The recently founded Clubhouse remains an audio-only social media
                      application, gaining strong popularity within the charity sector. The charities engaged in such a
                      platform during the initial years experienced phenomenal success in engagement and growth, using
                      it to raise awareness and funds. The platform contains no photos, videos, or graphics and is
                      concerned with social interaction only. The clubhouse remains structured into rooms with a feed
                      called corridor or hallway. Even though it is popular, charities must use platforms suiting their
                      mission and needs. Charities can also consider a similar venture, such as Twitter Spaces, the
                      initiative followed by the clubhouse success. </li>
                    <li><strong>Donation through Text Drive: </strong>Another conventional and tech-friendly charity fundraising event
                      idea remains donation involving a text-to-donate drive. In such events, participants can donate
                      funds using their mobile devices. Besides containing information related to the charity event, a
                      direct link often appears in the text messages to allow donations, indicating the purpose and
                      location of money under transfer. A text-to-donate drive is an excellent way to add to a charity
                      event. A simple way of conducting such an event is to collect the audience's phone numbers and add
                      them to the marketing list of the charitable brand after receiving their consent. Offering value
                      such as future discounts, free swag, and other bonuses can help to persuade more people. Using
                      reliable and efficient software, improving the loading speeds, removing faulty links, and avoiding
                      repeated texts are vital for the success of such a drive.</li>
