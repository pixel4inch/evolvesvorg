The adoption of circular supply chains is poised to favored further by enforcement of stringent regulations related to waste disposal and recycling. Companies pursuing sustainable practices are slated to drive gains through compliance and government incentives along with consumers seeking sustainable and environmental-friendly products. </li>
                    <li> <strong>Indispensability of Inventory Management Software - </strong> Inventory management (IM) is referred to as a business`s process for tracking everything the business owns, ranging from equipment to products to materials. Businesses utilize IM software for inventory costing, tracking assets, producing documentation critical to business functioning, and creating work orders. Maintaining a balance between the supply and demand sides is very important for businesses. Therefore inventory management offers assistance in optimal strategy formation and stock good ordering. When a strong and organized inventory management system is implemented, a holistic view of the stock at hand is offered to the manager and the clients derive improved satisfaction levels. The warehouse manager is offered an incisive level of transparency into the whole supply chain and financial and operational advantages are derived. The criticality of inventory control is to lower the blocking of financial flows. This frees capital which would otherwise have been tied up in excessive inventory besides optimizing the liquidity stance of the enterprise. The use of correct inventory tracking modules assists business owners in taking faster decisions about the stock lying abandoned in the warehouse.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Growing Use of Robotics - </strong> Global supply chains along with supply chain management are anticipated to be transformed by significant investments in robotics. The domain is witnessing increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles and drones for seamless, streamlined logistics operations. Ongoing advancements are set to enable delivery of small goods by drones soon. Technological progress is anticipated to push autonomous or self-driving vehicles towards viable operations and enable them to make traffic decisions in an automated manner. Warehouse operators are expected to rely more on autonomous mobile robots to expedite labor-intensive and repetitive tasks. The productivity of supply chains is slated to receive a notable boost with the combination of robotic processes and sophisticated warehouse management software. Rather than replacing human workers, the move is likely to support human efforts as it accelerates repetitive, simple tasks. The use of robots for time-consuming tasks is anticipated to help companies in shifting human workers to higher-value and business-critical tasks to drive growth and improve customer experience.                  </li>
                    <li> <strong>Growing Importance of Integration - </strong> Ongoing efforts by companies to form partnerships and join hands with third parties are likely to result in integration of new components within the supply chain. Companies are looking forward to collaborate with third-party service providers to save on costs and improve customer service. Increasing attention of companies to deliver inland services is anticipated to reduce freight costs and streamline the supply chain. These supply chain integrations hold high relevance for shippers relying on land and sea transportation for products. The integrated service strategy accelerates delivery times and improves customer service. With an eye on supply chain optimization, more companies are likely to join hands with third-party logistics providers (3PLs) and rely on 3PL technologies. Engaged in offering outbound and inbound freight management services and handling order fulfillment on different channels, providers of 3PL services are anticipated to work with companies for enhanced supply chain management. In addition, the use of 3PL-based technologies aids integration of several management systems through API and their connectivity to the cloud. The integration helps supply chain participants in addressing limitations associated with in-house solutions. Various players are also expected to collaborate with businesses with digital solutions for better delivery estimates and streamlined operations.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Rise of SCaaS - </strong> The supply chain domain is witnessing increasing focus of companies on ‘Supply Chain-as-a-Service’ (SCaaS) model and outsourcing of activities such as production, inventory management and logistics. The outsourcing trend is poised to shrink the size of supply chain management teams, which would pay more attention to strategic decisions regarding improvement of supply chains. Smaller in-house teams would increase the significance and adoption of digital control towers intended to provide managers with comprehensive insights into supply chains. While the cloud is bound to provide supply chain managers with access to data, advanced technologies are slated to efficiently support SCM. The availability of SCM support on tap is anticipated to help players in avoiding infrastructure, maintenance and upgrade costs to cut overhead spending.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Short Product Lifecycles Demand Faster Supply Chains - </strong> Despite different product lifecycles, businesses rely on a single supply chain for different products. However, shorter product lifecycles and associated requirements indicate the need for more efficient and swift supply chains. The changing landscape requires organizations to rethink supply chains for accommodating changing lifecycles and maintaining bottom lines. Shorter product lifecycle is creating the need for efficient supply chains and better processes for responding to regular requirement of new products. The scenario requires a large number of small businesses to adapt and shift their attention away from manual approaches for inventory tracking. These players can benefit from advanced tools like inventory management solutions that ensure efficient inventory tracking and automate order management. Businesses are also anticipated to streamline reverse logistics for efficient management of obsolete products. </li>
