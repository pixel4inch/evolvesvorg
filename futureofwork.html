                  <p class=" m-0">The global economy and its busy and active workforce is witnessing a massive shift largely brought on by the technological advancements. A large percentage of the workforce is expected to shift to remote work environments. The process of understanding the forces at work is essential for obtaining an insight into the future of work and approaches and designing policies that can deliver optimized benefits. The pandemic-led shift towards work-from-home has made organizations realize that traditional jobs can be effectively done remotely. The shift without compromising over worker productivity has led companies such as Facebook and Twitter to permanently move certain roles to the virtual world. Companies offering remote work as an option are highly likely to attract, acquire and retain qualified and competitive people. Various prospective candidates are ready to give up a certain part of their pay package for the work-from-home opportunity. In addition, the remote work arrangement helps workers in achieve a notable savings in terms of time required to commute daily to and from their offices. The factor holds particular relevance for metropolitan areas known for high traffic congestion. </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p class=" m-0">The shifting workspace brought to fore key financial and productivity advantages that the employers want to hold onto while providing employees freedom to work from anywhere and any device. Hybrid work arrangement is taking shape and is anticipated to emerge as the future of work in the coming years. While remote work is evolving rapidly and gaining immense attention from businesses, hybrid is set to be the most prominent paradigm defining the future of work. Representing a blend of remote and office work, the hybrid model allows companies to adjust to the new normal without compromising over employee and business productivity. The work model encompasses various approaches that may vary as per specific requirement of companies. While some of the organizations are anticipated to pay more attention to remote work, others are likely to require employees to attend offices for certain days of the week. On the other hand, several companies are anticipated to bet more on office work and provide only a small fraction of workers with the remote work option. The anticipated surge in popularity of hybrid model can be credited to associated perks. The work arrangement allows companies to hire local candidates as well as qualified professionals from anywhere. While local candidates would be required to come to the office, employees from different time-zones are likely to enjoy flexibility in terms of work schedules. In addition, the arrangement is expected to help organizations in achieving notable savings in terms of electricity and rentals as a limited number of employees would attend the office.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">However, adapting to work-from-home option takes time as well as requires companies to invest in suitable technology. The remote work option is also associated with a learning curve, requiring companies to focus on effective technology and policies for facilitating seamless transition without an impact of worker productivity. Organizations are paying attention to rethinking existing communication means for ensuring seamless connectivity and collaboration among employees. This ongoing shift of work space from computers to mobile devices needs to be empowered by a carefully delineated digital strategy for hassle free remote working and companies must make a conscious move away from standardized on premise systems to devising innovative user-focused cloud-based scalable document sharing systems that work well with multiple devices from mobile phones to tablets and are aimed at enhancing user experience. Switching to high performance conferencing and communication systems such as Slack and Microsoft Teams promotes greater team collaboration. To promote an optimal balance between work from home and work from office, some companies are allocating devices for home office facilitating seamless intra weekly switchover from home office to working at office. Remote-centric companies are aiming at assigning freedom of choice to optimize work-life balance and socialization requirements of employees. As the remote work trend gains further traction, customer engagement, product design and management, user experience management and research, lead training and culture experience management are emerging as key roles and are being rolled out extensively to be fulfilled by remote workers. Companies keen on riding the Hybrid work space trend need to collaborate on devising optimal digital strategies to retain their geographically dispersed work force and to unleash their best productivity well into the future, constantly keeping them motivated and engaged while providing work-life balance.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Technological developments in today’s modern era are likely to affect the future of work in the following ways.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automation and Resultant Substitution of Labor with Machines -</strong> The share of manufacturing in the overall employment sector continues to decline from more than 30% during the 1950s to less than 9% share at present. Automation is one of the key reasons for reducing share, as companies leverage automation technologies to manufacture a wide range of products with lesser employees. Jobs across various service sectors are expected to go through a similar kind of decline. The most susceptible to less susceptible jobs range from simple, monotonous, and repetitive to enhancing, complicated, and creative ones. Jobs that fall under the low-risk category are the ones that need greater cognitive abilities such as technical abilities, emotional or social connections, technical abilities, cross-disciplinary faculties, and creativity. These trends need not be essentially negative from a social, labor, or economic perspective. Automation can be useful when it aids in resolving the shortage of labor or any other source of economic disruptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scaling & Speeding Human Capability -</strong> Technology has been playing a great role in improving the capabilities of humans. In the area of robotics, the latest advancements in artificial intelligence labs are leading to the development of sophisticated robotics, which can place objects irrespective of size, make beds, pick, grip, and spin. Language translation technology is eliminating restrictions in online trading, thus having a substantial impact on the economy. The advent of machine learning translation applications on online platforms can lead to a rise in international trade between the parties. Language obstacles between human beings restrict trade, and machine-based translation minimizes the requirement of humans to for involving in translation-motivated searches prior to implementing a transaction. Though automation of technology has positive applications, the scale and speed with which human jobs are getting increasingly automated is indefinite and is likely to lead to significant dislocations for workers in most susceptible professions. Many are accepting independent jobs via online platforms as a supplement or alternative to conventional jobs. A rise in online platform economy has allowed employees as well as employers, businesses, and suppliers, and consumers and suppliers to locate each other and exchange goods and labor. </li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/ Mixed Reality Catalyze Future of Work -</strong> Defining the structure and outline of the future of work is very challenging and arduous, considering the influence of novel technologies, the continuous changes, and the probable shifts in the model. With the rise of novel hardware generations such as Meta Quest Pro, focus on business usage as well as the associated business applications would be improved as an increasing number of industries and companies evaluate the opportunities of immersive technologies. The amount of shared screen work would account for in the AR or VR is likely to determine in the near future. The technology is disrupting the way the work is carried out in the present time, and VR headsets are likely to become as common as a display screens. VR technology has been part of gaming technology for the past several years but without any major progress. With players such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Meta, the areas of immersive realities, equivalent research, and related devices have garnered significant attention in the past few years. The technology started reaching increasingly in the market, mainly focusing on the gaming industry, in the year 2014, when Meta (Back then known as Facebook) acquired Oculus. The application areas of VR technology also started evolving for which immersive technology could prove to be advantageous as well as useful such as businesses and enterprises in general. Technologies such as metaverse and VR are anticipated to grow similarly to mobile technology and contribute significantly to any country’s GDP in the years to come. Companies such as SAP have already employed immersive technologies through proofs-of-concept and showcases. A growing number of companies are keen to explore the potential of immersive technologies such as Mixed Reality, AR or VR to be used in various new applications such as digital twins of industrial assets. This enables the employees to virtually visit a unit to carry out the maintenance task without the need to be physically present at the unit, while the experience could be the same as walking down through the particular building. Companies such as Meta are restating their products and aiming at enterprise and business contexts. Many companies are likely to launch new products or successors of their existing products in the near future. Apple may launch a devoted AR device that could offer an increased immersive experience to its current apps available on the Apple ARKit. Companies are likely to continue gauging immersive technologies and enhance their usage in the business context. 
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      With the growing number of customer needs to make their businesses more collaborative, flexible, and immersive, companies are considering VR for their future strategies. Besides proof of concepts and showcases with customers in the initial years, first customer projects focus on the productive utilization of immersive technologies which are likely to integrate effortlessly into the current ecosystem of enterprise products and software. However, the technology needs to overcome certification, authentication, and security issues, in order to be able to securely and robustly use the new technology. In the future, a growing number of meetings are likely to be conducted in virtual collaboration environments such as Horizon Workrooms, or RAUM VR, while integration with already operational collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom would also be possible. Virtual avatars are likely to move to the next level and would be able to convey facial expressions and make eye contact, thanks to the advanced VR hardware such as the Oculus Quest Pro that comes with facial and eye expression tracking. As immersive technologies continue to progress from niche showcases or applications to operational applications and enter enterprises, businesses are considering using immersive solutions and applications for developing newer products and widening their current portfolio. Various customer projects utilizing the novel immersive application stacks and technology are live and allow the companies as well as their employees to spread their workday with applications in AR or VR. A growing number of routine work applications are being launched as AR or VR versions besides their conventional ones. Working in augmented or virtual realities and creating suitable solutions needs devoted devices such as AR glasses, VR headsets, or both. As immersive technologies are increasingly becoming part of routine everyday work, their related hardware is now available through the regular purchasing process in companies such as screens and laptops.     
Virtual reality (VR) is going to play an increasing role in business and work in the coming years. Several industries have already begun the shift to the virtual world, be it treating anxiety disorders to planning rooms and building in the construction and furnishing industries. Technology and digitization will disrupt and change work patterns. Innovation is taking place at a faster pace. Global challenges are also contributing to the move toward digitization.  Companies are on the lookout for a digitally savvy workforce that can adapt to the changing ways of working. The business environment is volatile and cutting-edge innovation has enhanced business efficiency, productivity, and continuity. The state-of-the-art digital environment necessitates a flexible work culture, one that is holistic. A motivated workforce can go a long way in shaping the future of the company and ways of working. Businesses now have access to immersive technologies, virtual worlds, and the metaverse. These technologies facilitate connection and collaboration with talent. Advanced business applications can be deployed by harnessing immersive solutions. VR technology is making inroads into defense, aerospace, healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, retail, and education.



                    </li>


                    <li><strong>Immersive Technology-Based Solutions -</strong> Bigger enterprises are likely to launch immersive technology-based products and solutions in their product portfolios in the near future. This indicates that immersive applications as well as dedicated devices are gaining momentum in routine work and the market. AR and VR have become a crucial part of several industries and business applications and their importance grows alongside devices such as conventional screens and laptops. In line with this trend, for certain business applications, particularly collaborative ones, the preference for utilizing desktop versions nearly moved to immersive technologies. Additionally, the rising number of live customer solutions including AR or VR scenarios incorporated into the established business ecosystems and applications indicate the demand and acceptance rate in the market. Immersive solutions, particularly in VR, have become a crucial economic growth factor for businesses. Technologically, the advanced generation of VR glasses would mark the next step in the development of avatars as photorealistic “Codec Avatars” and will foray into the virtual environment to get digital identity to a new level in terms of self-identification. With avatars looking more like their users, they are likely to identify themselves more with virtual representation. Besides, the ergonomics of VR devices have improved dramatically in terms of battery life, optics and weight, allowing the user to use them for longer periods of time with lesser eye fatigue. Employees spend a minimum of a third of their working day either in a virtual office or in attending remote meetings which today are generally being conducted in virtual environments. Though physical screens still exist, however, they can now be substituted with 3 large virtual screens in the virtual reality office. The related hardware can be seamlessly incorporated into the current office equipment. Customer meetings can be conducted in pleasing virtual environments, which further minimize travel expenses as well as time. Several industries have established virtual reality technologies. Besides office applications, several routine maintenances and inspecting tasks can also be moved to VR and can be conducted on the basis of digital twins of the complete machines, buildings, and industrial plants. Field technicians can virtually visit the power plant for inspecting the machines, and similarly, engineers that are present onsite can virtually attend the office meetings without the need of being physically present in the office.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quiet Hiring -</strong> Quiet hiring is increasingly becoming a strategy for savvy HR recruiters to focus on internal talent mobility. Instead of looking outside for new talent, they can upskill and stretch employees and not add to the headcount. The evolving organizational requirements are met by alternate approaches such as gig workers and alumni networks. These strategies provide only talent as needed without adding new full-time employees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Flexibility -</strong> Remote working has been accepted as the new working protocol even post-pandemic. Hybrid working offers employees the choice to work entirely in the office, work from home, or a mix of both. Employees save considerable commute time and add to productivity. They are freed from the shackles of the conventional 9 to 5 routines. The evolving company culture bridges the employees working individually and working together. The frontline force workers have significantly improved their experience during the pandemic. Frontline workers are also aspiring for control over their work schedules and stability in work schedules. </li>
                    <li><strong>Managerial Support -</strong> Managers have been overwhelmed by the rigors of the stressful working environment. Corporates must implement strategies that encompass flexibility, career opportunities, and hybrid work. Managers are often the only direct connection to the organizational culture, especially for remote workers. Managers must be supported with fresh support and training to address the gap in their managerial skills. They must be trained to address the relevant conditions as they exist now. Managers must also be trained in effective time management and redesigning of roles. </li>
                    <li><strong>Attracting Non-Traditional Candidates -</strong> Organizations have to expand and diversify their talent pool to include those following non-linear career paths. Traditional candidate pools and sourcing methods might not address the revised roles. There is a lesser emphasis on technical skills and industry experience. Candidates are assessed on their performance and not their prior experience or credentials. </li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainable Performance -</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on businesses as also employee resilience and performance. There is economic, political, and societal turbulence on account of the pandemic-related issues. Organizations will have to focus on employee mental health challenges. These might include initiatives such as discussions sans judgment or consequence, and no-meeting Fridays. On-site counseling can be provided by trauma counselors to train employees on dealing with workplace conflicts. </li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Focus on DEI -</strong> Not all organizations have been successful with their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts. Many employees feel a sense of discrimination on account of ideological and political trends. There can be subtle or obvious disconnection with marginalized groups. This can lead to reduced inclusion and engagement. Organizations will need to address this through DEI efforts before it blows into a disruptive resistance. </li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Employee Support -</strong> Significant employee data is collected through wearables, AI assistants, and other emerging technologies. Gathering information on employees’ family, mental health, and living conditions can help organizations to provide support. However, such information gathering is fraught with the risks of privacy violation. Deeply private and personal information must not be violated. Instead, an employee data bill of rights can ensure that there are healthy boundaries and that the data is deployed for employee wellbeing. </li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Bias of AI and Machine Learning -</strong> Organizations must be more transparent about the deployment of AI and ML in the hiring process. Government regulations on privacy protect the privacy of candidates and employees. AI can be deployed for diversity, fairness, and inclusion. </li>
                    <li><strong>Erosion of Social Skills -</strong> Younger people have been particularly affected by the pandemic and its repercussions. They haven’t got any experience with networking, social skills, negotiating, attentiveness, and social stamina. Thus, Gen Z faced career insecurity, burnout, and exhaustion during the pandemic. The entire workforce must be empowered with soft skills to face the new challenges of the times. The competitive landscape leaves employees pressured and exhausted. Innovative HR technology can be harnessed to focus on employee ethics and mental health issues.   </li>
                    <li><strong>Restructuring Companies for Efficiency -</strong> The evolving business environment has led to several companies like the Tata Group and GE have restructured operations improve competitiveness and remain relevant. Companies need to prioritize hiring and retention of employees that contribute to their bottom lines, as the skills and competencies of employees lead to enhanced productivity. SMEs (small and medium enterprises) account for a significant portion of the jobs created in emerging markets. </li>
                    <li><strong>Skills-based Hiring -</strong> Employers are increasingly moving away from conventional hiring based on degrees to skills assessment. Candidates backed with experience and not enough potential are overlooked in favor of those with relevant experience and willingness to develop their skills. This situation must be addressed with appropriate higher education reforms. Internships and apprenticeship programs can empower candidates with relevant experience to develop their skills. </li>
                    <li><strong>Talent Mobility -</strong> COVID-19 precipitated the move of skilled talent across countries and industries. Remote work powered by digital technologies and collaboration has resulted in a talented workforce moving across jobs at a faster pace. Companies too need to evaluate their work opportunities to factor in career mobility and transferable skills. But tighter border controls and higher trade tariffs might pose some challenges for the mobile workforce. </li>
                    <li><strong>Employment Giving Way to Work -</strong> Disruptive technologies and platform companies have given rise to recruitment opportunities that explore diverse alternatives. The rise of the gig economy has given rise to a talented workforce that works on demand. Talent strategy teams are exploring how to source human talent by broadening their horizons. Uber created work opportunities for millions of drivers across the world sans any driver employment contracts. The focus is now on ‘work’ rather than employment in the conventional sense. </li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Skills -</strong> Digitalization of industries has transformed the workplace. Employability skills have extended to include the use of digital technologies like IoT, AI applications, and robotics. This calls for skills such as critical thinking, extensive communication and collaboration, and emotional intelligence.</li>
