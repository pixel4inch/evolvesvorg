                  <p class=" m-0">The startup ecosystem in Europe is extremely diverse and complex. Europe is home to
                    several thriving startup ecosystems, whether at national level or concentrated in specific areas,
                    with each ecosystem having its own focus and uniqueness. Countries, such as Sweden, Spain, the
                    Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, and the UK, have consistently stood out as the top European as
                    well as global startup ecosystems. The UK’s startup ecosystem has been continuously growing and is
                    currently considered to be among the top-three in the world, attributed to the exceptional place
                    that the capital city London holds for startup development. London’s startup ecosystem has
                    demonstrated its resilience despite Brexit. The city is also the hub of the European VC industry, as
                    well as has developed a mature system for supporting young entrepreneurs through government funding.
                    The UK’s withdrawal from the EU paved way for Germany to emerge as the next major startup ecosystem
                    and entrepreneurial hub. In comparison to most of the other large cities in Europe, German cities
                    continue to offer cost-effective living options as well as have been able to attract a robust pool
                    of global talent. Growing interest in entrepreneurship and startup innovation, favorable government
                    support, and the country’s strong relationship to several global investment groups have led to the
                    emergence of several German cities in the top global startup ecosystems.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Some of the best European cities for startup development include London, Moscow,
                    Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Stockholm. London’s startup ecosystem encompasses
                    innovators across various sectors, including banking, fintech, ecommerce, and software, boasts
                    strong connections with the North American markets. The city ranks as the world’s third-leading tech
                    hub, the second-leading fintech hub, and the fourth-leading edtech hub. In 2021, London emerged as
                    Europe’s unicorn capital when the total unicorn count in the city scaled to 75. There are various
                    initiatives that the city of London offers to support tech startups, including the Resilience Fund,
                    a £1 million challenge fund aimed to incentivize innovators to address key challenging faced by the
                    city, and the Business Growth Program, which is focused on providing financial support to
                    early-stage startups with less than 10 employees. London ecosystem provides startups an easy access
                    to affluent consumers and powerful corporations. In addition, the city offers a large population of
                    highly-skilled workforce, both domestic talent due to the presence of several prestigious
                    universities and the international talent that the city attracts owing to its strong global
                    reputation. In 2021, London attracted tech investment worth more than €11 billion, substantially
                    surpassing the combined investment in Paris and Berlin. However, the high cost of living and
                    salaries, along with the lack of affordable coworking spaces and incubators, are some of the major
                    challenges that startups generally face while operating in London. Some of the notable London-based
                    startups include Lottie, HumanForest, and Zilch. Lottie offers a free-of-cost digital service to
                    help retirees and families find the best elderly care homes and retirement living communities in the
                    country. The company, founded in 2021, has been continuously securing funding that has led its
                    valuation to reach over €52 million. HumanForest is engaged in delivering a shared electric bike
                    service in the city of London. In early-2022, the company announced entering into partnership with
                    food delivery unicorn Deliveroo for boosting affordable and sustainable delivery services across
                    London. Founded in 2019, the company had raised €1.4 million via a Crowdcube campaign in late-2020.
                    Zilch is one of the fastest-growing fintechs in Europe offering a unique next-generation payment and
                    buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform that works directly with consumers. Founded in 2018, Zilch, a
                    double unicorn, secured an additional US$50 million in funding in mid-2022, taking its total Series
                    C funding to US$153 million. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">In recent years, Berlin has emerged as a major hub for startups both in Germany as
                    well as Europe, with nearly 22% of all startups in the country being established in the city.
                    Berlin’s startup ecosystem benefits from the city’s diversity and presence of several universities.
                    Berlin actively offers support to startups both in the pre-startup and early-stage period. For
                    instance, Berlin Startup Scholarship, a program financed by the state of Berlin with the support of
                    the European Social Fund, offers financial support to tech-based startups. In addition, the
                    investment division of Investitionsbank Berlin has been investing in innovative startups. Some of
                    the notable Berlin-based startups include Ecoligo GmbH, Grover GmbH, and Zenjob GmbH. Ecoligo is an
                    impact investment provider that implements solar-as-a-service projects in emerging markets. The
                    company, founded in 2016, recently secured funding of €10 million from investors. Grover, on the
                    other hand, is involved in providing an online platform for renting tech products through monthly
                    subscriptions. The company, founded in 2015, recently received €270 million in funding. Zenjob,
                    founded in 2015, offers an online staffing platform to help students and workers to find flexible
                    part-time jobs. The company recently raised €45 million in a growth funding round that would be
                    utilized to expand its presence across Europe.</p>


                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Capital cities have been at the spotlight of startup development in Europe and France
                    is no exception. Paris ranks among the globally leading startup ecosystems, driven by governmental
                    support through tax incentives and other initiatives, along with the growing popularity of the
                    entrepreneurship mindset. The city is home to close to 12,000 startups and the number is
                    continuously growing with the French government allocating large sums of money in its budget for
                    supporting startup development. In addition, the government reduced the corporate tax to 25% in
                    2022, thus making France an attractive destination for both domestic as well as international
                    startups. Other initiatives, such as a 30% tax credit to tech startups on their initial investment
                    are also encouraging the growth of the French startup ecosystem. Paris also benefits from the
                    presence of a renowned engineering university and several top-class business schools, all of which
                    are contributing in fostering domestic talent as well as innovation. Some of the prominent
                    Paris-based startups include Upway, Back Market, and Gourmey. Upway, which offers an online
                    marketplace for second-hand electric bikes, raised funding valued at €23 million in mid-2022 to be
                    utilized for expanding the company’s presence in the US, the Netherlands, and Germany by end-2022.
                    Back Market, founded in 2014, offers an online marketplace for refurbished electronic appliances and
                    devices. In early-2022, the company raised €449 million and established itself as one of the most
                    valuable startups in France, with a valuation of more than €5 billion. Gourmey, on the other hand,
                    is engaged in developing lab-grown, non-animal meat. The company, launched in 2019, secured €48
                    million in Series A funding in late-2022. Amsterdam is another European city with a vibrant startup
                    ecosystem, comprising several young entrepreneurs and a large number of female founders. Amsterdam
                    startup ecosystem covers various sectors, ranging from traditional industries to new sectors, such
                    as green-tech. Moscow also ranks among the top European and global startup ecosystems, primarily
                    attributed to significant government support, in conjunction with the city’s focus on retention and
                    scaling via access to a massive domestic market. However, Russia’s geopolitical situation continues
                    to pose challenges for the startup ecosystem in Moscow, which many startup facing travel and
                    financial restrictions while planning international expansion.</p>

                    Up to Disburse €1.13 Billion to Tech Startups in 2023, But Is It Enough?</button>

                  <p class=" m-0">The European Innovation Council (EIC) recently announced plans to disburse €1.6
                    billion to innovators and scientists in 2023 with the aim of scaling up breakthrough technologies as
                    well as creating new markets. Around 70% of the total amount, or €1.13 billion, has been earmarked
                    for the EIC Accelerator for supporting SMEs and startups towards the development and marketing of
                    high-impact innovations. Specifically, €525 million has been reserved for startups to develop future
                    technologies that would contribute to the various strategic objectives of the EU, including the New
                    European Bauhaus initiative, space tech, resilient agriculture, semiconductor or quantum components,
                    energy storage, decontamination for pandemic management, and cancer biomarkers. The balance €613
                    million would be made available for innovations in other areas of technology. The work program of
                    the EIC for 2023 also focuses on other significant objectives, such as increasing the flow of
                    innovative talent into deep tech startups, providing enhanced support to women innovators, and
                    facilitating the collaboration between public and private procurers. The support provided by the EIC
                    to date has resulted in a portfolio of EIC companies achieving a cumulative valuation of more than
                    €40 billion, including 112 centaurs and 12 unicorns. In addition, the EIC funding has contributed in
                    incentivizing more than €10 billion in follow-on investments in its portfolio companies from the
                    private sector. While at the outset the EIC’s funding of €1.13 billion for tech startups might seem
                    a significant amount, several experts are of the opinion that it is not enough given the size of the
                    massive European tech startup ecosystem. It must be noted that private investment in UK deep tech
                    startups alone touched €8.5 billion in 2021, which allowed for the exponential growth in the sector.
                    Experts also note that in case the EIC’s funding of €1.13 billion is allocated equally among the
                    bloc’s 27 members, each country would end up receiving only around €42 million. Industry experts
                    highlight that Europe is home to a large number of tech companies, has a skilled workforce, and
                    equipped with the required infrastructure for establishing itself as a tech powerhouse. However,
                    what is limiting the region in this regard is the lack of adequate financial support. Experts point
                    out the both the local governments as well as the EU would need to further increase funding in the
                    emerging tech startups in case the continent intends on competing with the major players in the US
                    and China.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">The European startup ecosystem has been exhibiting a steady growth over the past few
                    years, with several European countries ranking among the world’s leading startup ecosystems.
                    However, the startup scene in Europe is still not at the same level as in other regions across the
                    globe. The leading European hubs considerably lag behind those in the US in terms of talent,
                    capital, concentration, and size. One of the key strengths of the European startup ecosystem is that
                    it is well established offers high attractiveness to a wide range of investors. However, European
                    startups face the challenge of retaining their talent pool, since the continent’s cultural mindset
                    values successful exits, particularly in countries such as France. Close working relationships and
                    ties between various participants in the European ecosystem can play a critical role in fostering
                    growth and innovation, particularly with government relationships facilitating further connections.
                    The relative strength of the European startups in the B2B space and the region increasingly
                    embracing a digital economy would bode well for the European startup ecosystem. Another major
                    strength for the European startup ecosystem is the region’s stronghold in attracting tech funding.
                    Investment in European tech startups increased by a staggering 500% during the period 2012-2017 and
                    touched US$25 billion. London is one of the leading European hubs for fintech startups, and holds
                    tremendous potential in driving technological developments over the next few years. In addition, a
                    large number of European countries have begun offering e-visas and flexible residency permits for
                    attracting entrepreneurs from across the globe. This move is in conjunction with governments
                    offering flexible regulations for supporting the emerging startups. Moreover, Europe’s English
                    proficiency has been consistently strong, with the EU as well as the Schengen Area countries
                    displaying higher levels of English fluency as compared to other countries. High English proficiency
                    can help startup ecosystems in attracting global talent as well as international investors. Despite
                    the positive outlook of the European startup ecosystem, it also has certain limitations. One of the
                    biggest drawbacks of the European startup ecosystem is that it has failed in creating startup
                    giants, such as Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and Google. No startup has come even close to the
                    authority and scale of the startups emerging from the US. In addition, the startup ecosystem in
                    Europe has evolved at a slower pace in comparison to the US. While the VC firms in the US were first
                    established in the 1940s, they came into being in Europe only in the mid-1990s. Another major
                    limitation for the European startup ecosystem is the lack of government support, with governments in
                    countries, especially Italy, Greece, and France, imposing excessive and stringent regulations
                    pertaining to taxation and employment, making it difficult for startups to attract and retain
                    talent. Moreover, the culture mindset towards entrepreneurship is less prominent in European
                    countries as compared to the US. </p>

Some of the prominent startups that earned unicorn status in 2019 include Vinted, a Lithuania-based online marketplace for buying, selling and exchanging used clothing and accessories; Doctolib, a French cloud-based appointment scheduling and patient referral tool; and German neobank N26. However, despite growing at a brisk pace, European startups continue to fall short in accomplishing successful late-stage results in comparison to other regional startup ecosystems. Though Europe’s startup ecosystem is changing quickly, the region is still marred by lesser number of startups, startups raising less money, and lower chances of startups becoming successful in securing Series C funding, going public, or getting acquired. Even though Europe generates 36% of all formally-funded startups, its contribution in the global list of unicorns is only 14%. Adjusted to GDP and population, the number of seed-stage startups generated by Europe is merely 40% of that the US generates. Moreover, European startups have historically been 30% less likely in achieving late-stage successes as compared to their US counterparts. Further, European startups have consistently displayed lower success at progressing through different funding rounds as compared to the startups in countries, such as the US and India. Though startups in Europe are less successful at progressing through funding rounds, they cannot be considered as outright failures. Despite making slow progress in advancing to subsequent funding rounds, European startups are not likely to go out of business more frequently than US startups. European startups are 10% more likely to stall after bagging Series A funding as compared to US startups. This could be because these startups eventually become profitable and start exhibiting growth and hence opt for self-funding. However, this could result in them sacrificing future growth potential. The move could also have a negative effect on venture capitalists, for whom high profitability might not be enough, but achieving late-stage successes through IPOs or large acquisitions might be important for gaining high returns on investment.</p>
