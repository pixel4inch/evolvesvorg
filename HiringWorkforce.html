                    <p class=" m-0">The hiring and workforce space continues to evolve, transformed by the megatrends that are offering not just a host of opportunities for market players but also presenting numerous challenges. Unlike the earlier rigid structures, the present day workforce is characterized by flexible arrangements, in line with the changing needs of both employers and employees. Employees are increasingly opting to work on their own terms, and seek jobs that match their skills and compensation expectations. On the other hand, employers are opting to employ workers after careful evaluation of their needs, and assessing the need for various skills across the organization. Also influencing the labor market is the increasing role of technology as replacement for several tasks, in the process creating new jobs and changing nature of existing jobs. There is also a significant shift in demographic mix and skills requirements, which is leading to talent shortage in various industry verticals. </p>

                    <p class=" m-0">While the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in loss of jobs due to layoffs and resignations especially in middle and back-office areas, the post pandemic period presents opportunities for companies to hire new and better talent and also look for talent to fill-in newer roles attributed to the crisis. Labor shortage is also leading companies to offer higher compensation, provide hybrid work schedules, and mentor in-house or remote workforce. Also, the pandemic led people in several industries to retire early or seek alternative jobs to maintain work-life balance. Several of them are taking up gig offers or becoming entrepreneurs to benefit from the flexibility of working from home. Though economic and geopolitical factors continue to impact hiring trends, hiring intentions remain stable, with organizations focusing on attracting and retaining people mainly to counter the growing competition from rivals. Digital roles and technology skills continue to drive demand for talent worldwide. Consumer spending on services will create employment opportunities in hospitality-related sectors, whereas skilled workers are expected to find demand from finance, banking and insurance industries. Hiring sentiment remains strong in Asia-Pacific., with countries such as India, China and Australia reporting strong hiring outlook.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Shift towards Gig Economy -</strong> The emergence of the gig economy is defining the workforce concept. A growing number of individuals/job seekers in various industry verticals are exhibiting preference for gig works, or taking jobs involving shorter tasks or services as against traditional full-time jobs. Professionals are also opting for freelance works or time-bound projects, which not just enables them to work on their own terms but also provides exposure to various work environments and assignments. Such gig works provide employees with better career prospects. The recent years have been witnessing a growing number of individuals opting to work as temps or freelancers. However, the shift towards gig economy requires changes to the social protection systems to meet the changing needs of the labor world.</li>
                      <li><strong>Growing Skills Shortage -</strong> Globally, a growing number of employers in various industries are concerned by increasing shortage of talent, despite the fact that several countries are witnessing high unemployment rates. The reason for such talent shortage is the fact that existing workers lack the skillsets needed for new jobs that are being created in a changing world. Since new jobs require new set of skills, there is severe shortage of talent in the market. Staffing service providers have a critical role to play in alleviating the talent shortage by facilitating upskilling and reskilling of workers.</li>
                      <li><strong>Changing Demographic Mix -</strong> The demographic mix of the world is changing dramatically, with declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancies resulting in an increase in the elderly population specifically in developed regions. With population aging rapidly, there is a significant reduction in workforce thus causing talent shortage. The changing demographic mix is also transforming the way in which people seek to work, with growing number of individuals opting to continue working event after their retirement, in the form of temp staff or freelancers. Another significant demographic shift being witnessed is the growing significance of the millennial generation in the global workforce. The tech-savvy millennials have varied expectations about work profile and employers. This in turn necessitates greater level of flexibility and variety on part of employers and employees. Staffing companies possess the expertise and knowledge to address the needs of labor world amidst the rapidly changing demographic mix.</li>
                      <li><strong>Automation, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence -</strong> Automation solutions and robots are increasingly being used to perform a number of repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on high-value functions. In the coming years, the combination of automation and flexible solutions will translate into productivity improvements for employers. The implementation of automation solutions will raise the demand for skills required by such client companies. This is driving staffing companies to make significant investments in training and development initiatives. Automation and AI would advance, increasing the need for skilled personnel to use and operate these advanced technologies. This trend is expected to remain prominent for the foreseeable future. While the use of AI in workplaces is becoming increasingly commonplace, going forward, AI, together with automation, is expected to significantly impact nearly all facets of the workforce - most significantly finance and HR. The use of chatbots, or programs that enable text conversations, together with similar types of AI, will enable businesses to reduce their annual salary bills substantially.</li>
                      <li><strong>Digitization, Big Data & Analytics -</strong> The hiring industry is evolving from the earlier branch-based form of delivery towards a mix of offline and online business models, mainly driven by the adoption of digital business models in various end-use markets. Such a shift towards digital business models is creating new opportunities for staffing services and leading to the emergence of new job roles in new locations and previously under-served areas. The digitalization trend has significant implications for the recruitment market, and is leading to the advent of new data-driven business models in the staffing industry.</li>
                      <li><strong>Growing Skills Imbalances & Skills-Based Hiring -</strong> Globally, a growing number of enterprises and businesses are raising concerns over the shortage of talent, despite the fact that several countries are witnessing high unemployment rates. The reason for such talent shortage is the fact that existing workers lack the skillsets needed for new jobs that are being created in a changing world. For example, the growing adoption of robotics and automation is expected to require existing workforce to gain new skills over the next two decades. Since new jobs require new set of skills, there is severe shortage of talent in the market. Employment service providers have a critical role to play in alleviating the talent shortage by facilitating upskilling and reskilling of workers. With companies confronting growing need to deliver results in short-to-medium terms, there is growing focus on hiring skills backed by experience rather than potential. This trend has led to reduced demand for graduate recruitments, with employers favoring skills assessment as against degrees. The shift is necessitating youth to leverage work-integrated learning opportunities available in the form of internship, apprenticeship and placement programs that offer pertinent experience in development of skills.</li>
                      <li><strong>Mobility of Talent -</strong> As demand rises for skilled talent, there are considerable opportunities for some workforce to move across industries, jobs, and countries. The pandemic-driven remote work approach and rise in digital technologies has made it possible to collaborate, enabling skilled talent to move between jobs and also take-up multiple jobs at a time. Companies and individuals are now assessing work opportunities on a broader scale and on a global level, thus accelerating career mobility and supporting development of transferable skills that enable multiple job opportunities over a lifetime.</li>
                      <li><strong>Decline in Employment Rise of Work – </strong>The emergence of platform companies is changing the rules of employment. For instance, companies like Uber offer work to several people around the world without entering into an employment contract with drivers. Further, the gig economy is providing significant opportunities for companies and individuals to gain access to vast and diverse talent pool for performing on-demand tasks, in the process undermining the structures underpinning employment security.  These changes are also impacting the way organizations recruit, with talent strategy teams evaluating ways to address HR needs as against earlier HR departments that existed to manage employees. Further, role of analytics tools is growing for performance measurement as part of efforts to offer holistic talent management at workplace. </li>
                      <li><strong>Digital Skills -</strong> Digital transformation of industries has resulted in shift in the workspace, with organizations across industries evolving into tech companies. In this scenario, employability is no longer only about soft skills such as communication, critical thinking and collaboration. With the rising use of AI, IoT and robotics employability skills are revolve around the ability to use these technologies in the workplace.</li>
                      <li><strong>Mobile & Social Recruiting -</strong> With an increasingly number of people owning smartphones, the emergence of a more mobile-friendly hiring process is essential. Candidates are increasingly using their smartphones to search for job opportunities, which necessitates HR sites to be optimized for mobile phones. The trend of social recruiting is expected to become more prominent in the coming years.</li>

                    <p class=" m-0">Gone are the days when HR managers would volumes of resumes to pick a pool of candidates and conduct interviews. Significant expenses were incurred on posting job openings, perusing, meeting, interviewing, and selecting candidates, and onboarding. Conventional hiring techniques are now replaced by AI-based recruitment methods. AI algorithms scrutinize scores of potential profiles or resumes. The AI bot can streamline the recruitment process and schedule interviews. It can even conduct initial interactions and orientation. The recruitment cycle is thus significantly shrunk. Analytics and real-time information also influence the recruitment practice. AI-based methods can better gauge employee performance and competence, and assess if they add value to the organization. The AI chatbot can conduct basic queries and routine assessments. The AI tools measure employee satisfaction and retention rates. Recruiters can make decisions accordingly.  AI is becoming an intrinsic part of recruitment technology. With continuous upgrades and improvements, the recruitment landscape will change forever. AI-enabled sourcing technology facilitates automatic candidate sourcing. The benefits surpass those that could have been handled by a single recruiter. Hundreds of profiles in the database can be quickly scanned and valuable data insights can be gathered. The AI recruiting tools can be customized. AI recruitment involves biometric analysis that encompasses candidate quality and authenticity assessment.  While recruitment teams spend considerable time filtering candidates, the use of AI-powered tools can free up recruiter time for relationship-building. The soft skills of the candidate can be evaluated. Social media can be skillfully wielded to find matching candidates from vast networks.</p>
                    
                    <p class="m-0">Following are the ways in which AI can transform the recruitment process: </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Programmatic Job Advertising -</strong> Job advertisements are programmatically created and distributed. The Programmatic job tool analyses the employer’s background of recruitment ads and estimates its performance. Job ad placements can be appropriately scheduled on the right platform to address the right pool of candidates. </li>
                      <li><strong>Recruitment Marketing Software -</strong> Staffing strategies are increasingly becoming marketing-centric. The recruitment marketing software creates interesting job content for the ads and builds the employer brand too. Such a form of soft selling finds better appeal among candidates.</li>
                      <li><strong>AI Chatbots for Recruitment -</strong> Chatbots have been deployed in the recruitment sector to aid the pre-screening of candidates and interview scheduling. The text conversations are human-sounding and are harnessed to collect candidate responses, documents, and information. The AI chatbots are instinctive and use text, chat, and email for communication. The recruitment chatbots have a conversational interface that uses AI and machine learning. They schedule interviews and keep the recruiters updated on the number of interviews per day. The chatbots can be programmed to collect basic education and work experience. They can also answer common questions that candidates are likely to ask. Thus, a significant portion of the recruiting activities is automated and fed into an internal database or business ATS. The chatbot can multitask – it can reply to a candidate’s email and simultaneously work with the recruiter in the ATS and even contact another potential candidate on LinkedIn. Such multitasking would overwhelm a human recruiter and lead to errors. Chatbots aid recruiters by interacting with prospective candidates. CEIPAL is one such proprietary recruiting software that is built into the ATS platform. It provides a command-line interface that asks questions and saves recruiters significant time. The recruiters can ask for a summary of the answers to get a consolidated view. The client-facing chatbot and the internal chatbot can work simultaneously.</li>
                      <li><strong>Resume Database Filter-</strong> AI database filtering modules can check the candidate pools for possible matches to the currently open job orders. The AI recruiting technology then contacts candidates through email. It also scours social media profiles to look for possible candidates.</li>
                      <li><strong>Job Aggregators -</strong>AI recruitment technologies function as job aggregators to advertise job postings on job boards, career sites, and social channels. Interested candidates who navigate these job listings are seamlessly directed to the original listing. These aggregators can check and compare competitor salaries and profits.</li>
                      <li><strong>Reducing Bias -</strong> AI-driven software helps eliminate the biases that arise due to color and origin-based stereotyping. Machine learning algorithms and analytical insights reduce decision-making errors significantly. </li>
                      <li><strong>Fewer Errors -</strong> AI and Machine Learning are efficient technologies that take over the monotonous tasks associated with recruiting. Intelligent recruitment practices ensure that the recruiters can spend their time with the candidates more effectively. </li>
                      <li><strong>New Employee Onboarding -</strong> AI technology is useful in employee onboarding. The AI chatbots can guide the applicants through several processes and ensure speedier integration with the new organization.</li>
                      <li><strong>Rerouting Candidates -</strong> AI recruiting also facilitates candidate rerouting wherein candidates not found suitable for a particular job are routed to another organization. Organizations can thus find talented professionals easily. This approach is being increasingly followed by several companies. The recruitment landscape is poised for significant change. Conventional practices will give way to AI-assisted tools.</li>
                      <li><strong>Personalization of Candidate Experience -</strong> AI recruiting offers ‘real life’ conversations in text thereby providing candidates with a unique experience that mimics human-to-human interaction. Organizations are going all out to recruit talent, amidst heavy competition and other talent market shifts. AI-enabled ATS talent rediscovery assists organizations in picking best-fit candidates from their existing talent network.  With specific search queries and contextually-relevant search returns, recruiters can locate best-fit candidates from years back. The internal candidate data is blended with external candidate data to leverage talent assessment accuracy. This obviates the need for manual tracking and responding to candidates. Candidates too experience personalization with the use of advanced AI technology.</li>
                      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Performance Reviews -</strong> Data collection is intrinsic to the performance appraisal process. The data throws light on the employee’s achievements, potential, contribution to the organization, successes, and failures. By harnessing AI solutions, organizations can streamline performance management and performance review functions. Decisions can be data-driven thereby enhancing the organization and preparing it for the future. An AI-powered performance review solution uses the data that has been continuously collected. A centralized repository of data is maintained. The performance review process is made meaningful and free from erroneous judgments. Predictive analysis throws light on at-risk employees. AI tools can better match employees based on their skills and experience. AI is being increasingly deployed to offer transparency and accuracy to performance evaluations and promotions.</li>
                      <li><strong>AI in Workforce Management -</strong> Managing a workforce is no mean task, especially in times of hybrid working. AI-powered tools can offer optimum workforce management solutions to retain employees and improve performance. Smart WFM (Workforce Management) solutions are being harnessed to manage the workforce and generate work schedules. Several tasks can be automated where they can be conducted sans human interference. AI can be effectively used for future planning and optimum resource usage. With a vast workforce, organizations find it difficult to manage the workforce in an efficient manner using conventional methods. AI gathers data on employee skills and behavioral sets expected for each job. AI workforce management tools observe, maintain, and store employee data through forecasting, analytics, and tracking. The tools facilitate task scheduling, automated shift planning, budgeting, and managing malfunctions. It facilitates intelligent decision-making for improved productivity. AI will play a greater role in workforce management in the years to come. Predictive analysis will help estimate the best use for an employee’s time and skills. The errors of human appraisal are avoided. AI tools do not have to be supervised for fine-tuning scheduling. Machine learning tools can parse through humongous volumes of data to make informed decisions. There is a continual comparison of performance to the expected outcome. The feedback that is gathered helps the machine optimize its decision-making. These initiatives foster better workplace engagement. There is higher productivity and revenue generation. Optimal scheduling takes into account work-life balance and garners significant success for the organization. Employees too feel empowered and supported. The resultant seamless continuity of workflow and workload management leverages employee potential, and result in optimal resource usage and savings of time and costs.</li>
