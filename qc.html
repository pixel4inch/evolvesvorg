                    <li><strong>Space & Defense: </strong>Existing encryption standards depend on mathematical algorithms to encode data that are extremely challenging to break. Quantum computers are expected to eliminate the requirement of sequential trial-and-error techniques to process these complex mathematical problems. Quantum cryptanalysis is driving various countries to collect encrypted communications to extract secrets. The availability of quantum cryptanalysis is likely to influence international relations owing to its ability to decrypt intercepted or broadcast communications for military or other operations. While superconducting magnetometers relying on quantum technology for measuring any small change in magnetic fields to locate submarines, quantum radars are expected to detect low-observable aircraft. In addition, quantum technologies are being investigated to miniaturize atomic clocks intended for timing, navigation and position purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transportation Sector -</strong> Manufacturers in the transportation industry are anticipated to significantly gain from quantum computing owing to its ability to address different issues, right from design and development to repair and maintenance. The technology is likely to be used for making connected cars smarter, enabling next-generation electric vehicles, ensuring data security and optimizing traffic routing. Quantum computing is being exploited by various companies for developing autonomous cars capable of predicting traffic conditions and avoiding accidents using computational power. In addition, leading players are making efforts to simulate behavior of electronic/electric components and equip new car models with artificial intelligence.
