                  <p class=" m-0">Behind the euphoria around startups and their potential for huge success and for
                    raking in huge profits and reputation for the founders, there is always this dread of failure. The
                    odds most of the time are against entrepreneurs launching new businesses. Studies show that more
                    than 65% of startups never reach the stage of earning positive returns for their investors. Only ten
                    percent of startups are at any time worth investing and just one percent of them are bound to
                    succeed. Nonetheless, unnerved by these statistics, startups continue to emerge constantly in varied
                    industries and sectors and in countries across the world, both with products meant for local
                    communities and for international consumers. Analysis of various reasons of failure analysis is thus
                    vital for startups to avoid failure. </p>

                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Following are some of the reasons behind the failure of startups: </p>
                  <br />

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Founder Inadequacies:</strong> One of the main reasons why startups tend to fall short of what was
                      expected of them is associated with the founders. Most venture capital investors choose to invest
                      in a startup because of the founder and not the opportunity or the idea. Inadequacies of founders
                      had been one of the major causes behind a venture eventually stumbling. Founders in such cases
                      lack in several aspects necessary for building a business, including leadership ability and
                      industry acumen. Nonetheless, this is a simplistic answer to the question of why startups fail.
                      The situation is a complex one and merely blaming the lack of leadership abilities in founders
                      oversimplifies it. Sometimes, irrational moves of competition can also be the cause behind startup
                      failure. Often, the reason behind a startup venture becoming unsuccessful would be a common one
                      and also one which could have been completely avoided. Several ventures show promise initially but
                      crash eventually mainly due to the mistakes which could have been prevented. Early-stage
                      entrepreneurs failing to properly interpret market demand signals can also result in failure. A
                      pattern that is bound to doom a startup is inadequate talent of the captain for steering the
                      venture at hand. VCs therefore, generally look for captains with passion, resilience, and
                      experience. However, even with such talents, a startup could fail because there are several other
                      parties, contributions of which are critical to success. A wide range of stakeholders such as
                      strategic partners, employees and investors also play a key role in the downfall of a venture
                      along with the founder. Most of the time, a great founder is not even required for success of the
                      startup. The founder’s shortcomings can be easily compensated by other members in the management
                      team, advisers and also seasoned investors. These stakeholders can provide useful connections and
                      the needed guidance and a venture pursuing the right target opportunity would inevitably attract
                      such stakeholders and their contributions. </li>
                    <li><strong> False Starts:</strong> One more reason why startups fail is false starts. Startups generally introduce
                      MVPs and make iterations based on the feedback obtained. By launching MVPs and testing customer
                      response, founders seek to avoid squandering money and time building or marketing a product which
                      does not have target customers. However, startups usually end up wasting their valuable capital
                      and time and engineering efforts in launching such MVPs into the market, because most turn out to
                      be false starts. Such a practice of launching early and often failing fast eventually lead to the
                      startup’s downfall. </li>
                    <li><strong> Absence of Target Market:</strong> Creating something for which there is no market is cited as another
                      major reason behind failures of startups. The products they build or the services they create do
                      not have any real-life benefit. Products/services must make life easier for customers, save time
                      and improve their mood, and these are the basic purposes to be kept in mind while creating them.
                      If a product/service is not solving these issues then it carries no real value. It must either
                      improve the existing solution or solve a problem. Founders of startups are required to understand
                      from the beginning, target customers, their lifestyle preferences, interests, values, hobbies,
                      behaviors etc.</li>
                    <li><strong> Poor Hiring:</strong> Poor hiring could also result in failure for startups. Profitability and healthy
                      operations of a startup are based a great deal on workforce quality. The founder must be able to
                      build a cohesive team for taking their brand on the right path for ultimate success. Hiring poor
                      candidates costs both money and time for the company and additionally there is this cost of firing
                      and rehiring which takes a toll on reputation of the company and its productivity. Bad hires also
                      tend to impact other team members’ performance. Immense focus of all stakeholders, in addition to
                      the founder members, on pushing the startup towards success, is important. </li>
                    <li><strong> Burnout:</strong> Since founders of startups are typically unable to achieve work-life balance they
                      tend to burn out easily. Around 5 percent startups fail because of founder burn out. </li>
                    <li><strong> Overzealous Making Products Complicated:</strong> Overzealous entrepreneurs who try to integrate more
                      features to their products hoping that it would become more appealing to clients also tend to lead
                      the startup towards failure because often, more features make products complicated and reduce
                      their accessibility to all. Focus therefore must be narrowed down to the most critical functions
                      which would be useful for majority of customers. </li>
                    <li><strong>Neglected Sales & Marketing:</strong> Founders also become so focused on developing the product that
                      they neglect sales & marketing, the other most important aspects required for startup success. For
                      most founders, these crucial aspects of business building continue to be a mystery. They depend
                      mostly on the advisors or investors for assistance in this area. Creating an experienced sales
                      team ensures sustainability for the startup.</li>
                    <li><strong> Non-compatibility among Founders:</strong> Non-compatibility among founders is another reason why
                      startups generally fail. Starting a company and running it alone is difficult and running it with
                      non-compatible co-founders can be worse. Such situations can lead to several unresolved disputes
                      which can over time compound and wreak havoc on the company resulting in business failure
                      ultimately. Co-founders who share the vision, who are buoyant emotionally, and who have distinct
                      operational skills can play a major role in startup success. Also, creating a diverse team for a
                      startup, with the required skills, is highly important. Many startups that fail have raised too
                      much funding too early, because of the wrong team. The teams also fail to build MVPs on their own.
                      If the founding team is unable to create MVP and launch it in the market on its own, then there
                      are more chances of the startup failing. Often, the founder would also have failed to share the
                      vision with the team. Every action taken by the founders reinforces their value in front of the
                      team. </li>
                    <li><strong> Choosing Wrong Business Model:</strong> Choosing the wrong business model is also a major reason for
                      failure of startups. A clear business model is necessary before building a product. This has been
                      the reason behind 20% of startup failures in the recent years. The business model outlines the
                      path the company would follow to earn money, the revenue channels, the pricing model etc. When the
                      business model is not viable economically, the startup is bound to fail. </li>
                    <li><strong> Poor Execution of Product:</strong> Poor execution of product can also be cause for failure in many
                      cases. Despite an amazing idea and considerable success in raising initial funding many startups
                      fail too soon because their product/service would be poor. This mostly happens when launching
                      product in a capital intensive industry. </li>
                    <li><strong> Lack of Clear Market Need:</strong> A product must also have a clear market need for the startup to
                      succeed. The product/service must tackle an issue faced by a large enough market. Startups fail to
                      attract sufficient user pool for their product eventually, and would also tend to loose user base
                      built in the initial months. Popularity of the product/service would decrease because of the
                      inability of the company to retain customers and acquire new ones. Most of the time, such
                      products/services would be ahead of their time, trying to solve issues not yet manifested on a
                      large scale. </li>
                    <li><strong> Intense Competition:</strong> Intense competition can also be the cause behind death of startups. The
                      food delivery business is an example. Multiple food delivery companies are introduced regularly
                      and are also out of the market too soon mainly because of the competition. Established incumbents
                      offer fierce competition to the new entrants in such markets. </li>
                    <li><strong> Lack of Compelling Value Proposition:</strong> There would not be a compelling value proposition
                      causing customers to commit to actually buying the product or sometimes the market timing would be
                      wrong. Startups could be way ahead of the market by several years. Customers may not be ready to
                      accept the solution currently. Only a few companies have the required funding to make them survive
                      the initial years until the market for their products is created. </li>
                    <li><strong> Failure in Finding Product/Market Fit:</strong> Failure in finding the market or product fit is another
                      reason why startups generally fail. The first product brought to market by the startup would not
                      meet market need exactly and would need revisions for achieving the right market/ product fit. In
                      worst cases products would be completely off case requiring a total revamp and if such is the case
                      it clearly indicates that proper ground work has not been done before and during development of
                      the product. Startups must first validate ideas with target customers prior to developing them.
                      Around fifty such conversations are necessary to ascertain if a product concept would sell well.
                      Since startups mostly have founders with product/technical background and lack skills in dealing
                      with surveys involving potential customers, they usually skip this critical step before building
                      their product. Such startups would only obtain customer feedback when the product is out in the
                      market. Incorporating the feedback then would mean loss of several months. </li>
                    <li><strong> Failure to Find a Scalable Sales Motion:</strong> Startups also typically fail to find a scalable and
                      repeatable sales motion. If a product has a market/product fit it would start delivering value for
                      the business with customers wanting to purchase it. However, at this stage, the company must be
                      able to find and execute the right way of selling the product. Also called the go-to-market-fit,
                      the phase implies searching for a scalable and repeatable growth model. Entrepreneurs are
                      typically so optimistic about acquiring customers for their products that they fail to find
                      profitable growth models. Merely creating an attractive product/service and website for selling
                      that product or service does not guarantee customers. It may only happen with few customers
                      initially and soon it would become expensive to win new customers and retain existing ones. In
                      many causes startups see their CAC (Cost of Acquiring Customers) way higher compared to the LTC
                      (Lifetime Value of Customer). Startups must be able to acquire customers with less money. Failure
                      to create and execute a realist CAC is often the reason behind a startup’s failure. Furthermore,
                      in order to have a business that is capital efficient, an effective sales & marketing motion is
                      necessary. The metrics, Sales Efficiency and Months to CAC Recovery help understand this. For
                      instance, in a business with 100 percent gross margin, an efficient business would spend a dollar
                      on sales & marketing and create a dollar in net new ARR, implying that it would recover the CAC in
                      a year or have a 1 point sales efficiency. An inefficient business on the other hand would take 2
                      years to recover CAC or have 0.5 point sales efficiency. </li>
                    <li><strong> Weak Management Team:</strong> When the management team is weak, making mistakes in several critical
                      areas of conducting the business, such startups also have thin chances of succeeding. Such
                      management’s go-to-market strategies are typically poorly thought out and the execution is also
                      poor leading to multiple issues. </li>
                    <li><strong> Running Out of Funds: </strong>Running out of money too soon is another reason behind failure for
                      startups. The founding members’ team must have a clear understanding about how much money is left
                      and if it would be sufficient for carrying on before another round of raising cash begins. Startup
                      valuations do not change linearly with time. For increasing valuation, the company would be
                      required to achieve a few major milestones. For instance, a software company’s progress from the
                      seed round valuation could be a goal for removing a key risk element, creating a prototype or
                      obtaining customer validation for product. Even if the product is complete, without customer
                      validation valuation would not increase much. Valuation keeps increasing when product is in
                      shipping stage and when there is positive feedback coming in. Valuation increases further, when
                      the product/market fit concerns are eliminated. These are indications that the business is
                      beginning to ramp up. Once the business model becomes proven, it would acquire more customers and
                      CAC becomes reasonable. This is the stage when monetization from customers exceeds the cost of
                      acquiring them, indicating that the business succeeded in scaling well. However, what generally
                      goes wrong and companies tend to run out of cash and become unable to raise more money would be
                      the failure of management to achieve the subsequent milestones before they exhaust the available
                      cash. In most cases it would be still possible to secure funding even at this stage but company
                      valuation would become considerably lower. The major responsibility of the CEO of the startup
                      therefore would be to conserve cash. For instance, during the early stages when the product is in
                      development and sales motion is being created for making it scalable and repeatable, hiring must
                      be avoided. Unnecessary hiring at this stage would lead to fast burnout of cash. At the same time,
                      once the growth model is proven to be profitable, it would be the time for aggressive spending. At
                      this juncture, the CEO must start investing way more aggressively in hiring sales people.</li>

                  <p class=" m-0">In startup circles, it has lately become fashionable for people to proudly speak about
                    their failures. Failed entrepreneurs state that it is just a bad phase of their entrepreneurial
                    journey. While this could be their coping mechanism, in some cases, founders are completely in
                    denial of their failures or are depressed with their dreams shattered and self-confidence lost.
                    Startup failures take a toll not just on the founders but also on the society and the economy at
                    large because doomed ventures tie up resources which could have been put to better use elsewhere.
                    Startup failures also deter would-be entrepreneurs. Starting a new business with limited money and
                    other resources is also highly risky Nonetheless, startup failures can be avoided. Many failures
                    follow same trajectory and by recognizing this, failure numbers and their frequency can both be
                    reduced. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>For a startup to succeed, perseverance and hard work are important. Above these, there must be the
                    strong belief in the purpose. Entrepreneurs must be specific in understanding the problem they
                    intend to solve and create products which customers would need and not want. Instead of merely
                    chasing ideas, focus must be on solving issues. Constant revaluation of goals is also important for
                    success. Entrepreneurs must be open to making changes to plans, frequently. Startups pivoting more
                    increase chances of raising more money and would be less likely to prematurely scale compared to
                    those that do not. Knowing competition and how the product differs from that of the competition is
                    also critical. Other important questions that need answers include the size of the target market,
                    whether it is expanding or shrinking, barriers to entry, and if the business model chosen is
                    flexible enough to pivot when needed. Creating a committed and reliable team also greatly improves
                    chances of success for a startup business. Founders typically are wary about task delegation but the
                    practice must be shunned. Also, having a balanced team is important for helping founders brainstorm
                    quickly and strategize brilliantly. Balanced teams have technical founders and business founders and
                    such teams have more chances of user growth compared to just business heavy or technical heavy
                    founding teams. Startups must also not look towards scaling too quickly because such fail the
                    fastest. Before scaling, market trends must be thoroughly understood and analyzed for ensuring if
                    scaling makes sense based on the financial projections of the business.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Planning and research constitute the critical initial steps for ensuring feasibility of any startup
                    business idea. Research is also needed for ensuring competitive pricing which would bring in
                    adequate RoI. Investing in market research reports and following blog posts and university papers
                    can help in this area. Feedback can also be sought from trusted business associates. The next step
                    would be to have a well thought-out and realistic plan of action. Proper financial management is
                    also essential for startups of all sizes and so is a quality team of employees. Recruiting for
                    startups needs careful consideration because each employee recruited must be able to bring value to
                    the business, through a new skill. Startups must also ensure that all relevant marketing channels
                    are used. Social media can be used extensively for driving most business ideas forward in the
                    current scenario. Managing risks is also important for startup businesses. Insurance is generally
                    ignored and by doing so businesses are crippled in the event of an unforeseen incident occurring.
                    The business must therefore be protected with the right insurance. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Also, while guidance of conventional knowledge and wisdom can be good, entrepreneurs must not
                    follow it blindly. Entrepreneurs may most of the time truncate investigation and jump into creating
                    and selling a product. Often, this can lead to a flawed solution. Being persistent is also not
                    advisable. Setbacks are encountered by entrepreneurs, time and again. True entrepreneurs keep at it
                    out of their determination and resilience. However, it is important to see that such persistence
                    does not turn into stubbornness. Founders must be astute in recognizing false start and pivot when
                    the solution they created is not working. Delaying in such instances can eat up the cash, shortening
                    runaway for the venture. Also, being passionate is good but not all the time. The desire to create
                    solutions that can have world-changing powers entrepreneurs and it may also attract investors,
                    partners and employees but extremeness of such passion can result in overconfidence. Such
                    overconfidence would pave way for skipping crucial initial research. Entrepreneurs tend to be
                    blinded by passion and fail to recognize that the product they created is not meeting the intended
                    needs of customers. Startups sometimes would also be required to invest aggressively in hiring
                    talent. To consistently deliver on the value proposition, startups must not lack on crucial skills
                    and therefore must hire those with such skills who generally demand very high compensations.
                    However, startup founders are typically frugal in this aspect because the available resources
                    initially would be highly limited. They try to accomplish more with less and restrain themselves
                    from hiring. Startups must also not aim at a rapid growth. Rapid growth can attract talent and
                    investors and give the startup a morale boost but it may also tempt founders to cut short research
                    and launch product prematurely. Rapid growth may aggravate quality issues which would reduce profit
                    margins in the long run.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Entrepreneurs must commence work by conducting interviews with target customers.
                    Initial focus should be on defining problems faced by customers. Both early adopters that would
                    adopt the product early on and the mainstream prospects, who would be inclined for later purchases
                    must be interviewed. Success for startups would hinge upon attracting both these customer groups.
                    Needs of these two groups may differ, in which case, entrepreneurs must take into account such
                    differences while formulating roadmap for the product. Enterprises are also required to perform
                    competitive analysis, through user testing existing solutions. This would allow them to better
                    understand shortcomings and strengths of competing products in the market. Startups can conduct
                    surveys for measuring customer attitudes and behaviors. Data thus obtained can be extremely helpful
                    in sizing up potential market and in market segmentation. The subsequent step after defining the
                    problem is solution development. The team must brainstorm a wide range of possible solutions for the
                    problem and prototype many concepts and obtain feedback through one-to-one interviews with target
                    customers. Teams generally start off with crude prototype and rejecting and iterating until a
                    refined, higher fidelity version of the problem, which resembles the final marketable product more
                    closely in terms of functionality, feel and look is created. In the next step, the developed
                    solution is set for evaluation by running MVP tests. An MVP test is different from review sessions
                    for the prototype. MVP tests offer actual products to real customers, in real-world setting sand
                    seek their response. Such MVPs have lowest fidelity for avoiding waste. MVP tests help in assessing
                    proper demand for the product and many also kickstart a campaign or solicit LoIs for purchase from
                    B2B customers. Success in these processes of product design necessitate shift in the mindset of the
                    founders. Founders cannot have preconceived notions about problems faced by customers and also about
                    the solutions they intend to design for resolving those problems. Founders may believe that the path
                    taken is the right one and may become emotionally involved with specific pairing of
                    problem-solution, which could lead to failure of the product. Entrepreneurs therefore must remain
                    open to several new possibilities during the product design process. Sometimes the process may
                    uncover even more pressing issues than first defined and also better solutions than those identified
                    to solve those problems.</p>
