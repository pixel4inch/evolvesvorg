                  <p class=" m-0">Whether online or offline, raising funds for a cause has never been easy. It is an art that continues to be perfected even today in all its forms, be it capital campaigns, corporate support, online fundraising, earned income, grants, membership campaigns or special events. There is growing awareness among NGO and not-for-profit organizations about the overhyped effectiveness of social media. Despite all that has been said about social media, many nonprofits have realized that the return on investment (ROI) from using social media has been but negligible. There is a distinct shift therefore now to focus resources on the neglected digital marketing and fundraising tools. As disengagement from social media platforms gains momentum, a parallel focus will be shed on website redesign, email marketing for fundraising, designing and implementing a donor retention strategy, investments in innovative graphics design i.e. social media posts & banners; Infographics; email templates; website banners etc. Also expected to make a comeback and rise in popularity are tribute giving programs; adoption of Instagram fundraising tools; advertise on streaming platforms like Twitch.tv.  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p class=" m-0">Streaming platforms deserve special attention as young and wealthy media consumers including gamers cannot be reached through traditional outreach programs as they have a very low probability of responding to email pitches, gifts, or DMs. Building robust relationships with streamers can unlock a magic source of resources. NGOs will also be seen increasingly focusing on updating their knowledge on online privacy laws and prioritizing cybersecurity strategies. These strategies will include using premium hosting service for their websites, investing in tools that prioritize speed, security, and automated back-ups, deploying double opt-in and captcha for email subscriptions, and implementing two-factor authentication and other password management tools. </p>

                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Crowdfunding is emerging as another efficient way of bringing in money for projects but it is different from fundraising. While fundraising implies seeking financial aid/support for charity and such other related causes, crowdfunding constitutes the practice followed by budding entrepreneurs and businesses accumulating money from individuals for funding their business ideas.</p>

                    <li><strong> Fundraising in the Metaverse -</strong> Currently, several charities are capitalizing
                      on the metaverse
                      fundraising opportunities. These charities are the ones that exhibit higher risk tolerance and
                      have greater access to tech expertise. They could both be the small organizations with volunteers
                      or leadership that are tech-savvy and mega-charity organizations with the capability of hiring
                      highly able development teams. One of the key advantages with metaverse fundraising is that it can
                      bring together people and communities that care about issues. The internet facilitates this
                      metaverse fundraising. Often, due to dearth of resources and funding initially, non-profits cannot
                      afford launching massive promotional campaigns for attracting considerable attention to their
                      cause. An increasing number of such charitable organizations therefore are starting to recognize
                      advantages that advanced technologies can offer. AR/VR and such other advanced technologies for
                      instance, can offer substantial benefits to non-profits. Sometimes, a simple story or a photo
                      exhibition would not be enough for raising the needed awareness for achieving a fundraising goal.
                      The problem could be conveyed more efficiently and faster with VR and AR technologies which
                      provide a more interactive and engaging solution. Such campaigns stand a better chance of raising
                      needed funds for a cause importantly, in a shorter time duration.</li>

                    <li><strong> AR Apps Increase Effectiveness of Fundraising for Charities & Nonprofits -</strong> AR
                      apps are
                      increasing effectiveness of fundraising campaigns for non-profits and charities. The apps are
                      increasing awareness levels for the projects and engaging more people on deeper emotional levels
                      to empathize and donate to causes. Using AR apps can also be a cost-effective method as the
                      non-profits would not be required to invest much in developing and deploying the apps. However,
                      organizations intending to create a highly effective AR app for charity would be required to
                      analyze meticulously as to what interaction type could be ideal for their cause. AR apps help
                      non-profits in building awareness about their causes, in an effective manner. More people would
                      come to know of the problem which would make resolving it easier. The apps allow charities to
                      involve more people by covering more ground. When more people become aware then more donations can
                      be expected. The apps also help charities show the problem at hand form a completely new angle
                      which helps in getting potential givers deeper into issues. They could have a ‘Donate’ button for
                      calling people to act instantaneously. Charities can also use AR apps for providing potential
                      givers with updated information as the app processing is conducted in the real-time. Non-profits
                      could push updates on-the-go ensuring that users have access to the latest data at all times.</li>

                    <li><strong> Virtual Reality in Charity -</strong>Charities today are seeking newer ways of getting
                      across their
                      messages to potential philanthropy givers. Merely making a problem known is not adequate currently
                      as for making donors empathise with an issue they are required to be shown, and only then they
                      would be able to better connect with the depths of issues/crisis for which the donations are being
                      sought. Charity organizations therefore are actively exploring the technology of VR that helps
                      them place viewers inside the issue/crisis, literally, thus enabling them to achieve the maximum
                      empathy as well as the intention to help. VR makes such effects possible as it can create an
                      immersive experience. Viewers can be transported to virtual environments of distant physical
                      places. VR can recreate disastrous situations for helping viewers focus their attention. VR is
                      also being used by NPOs to increase awareness about issues in addition to raising funds. NPOs and
                      charities also use VR for reporting on how the funds have been spent. The organizations can create
                      film documentaries, photos and report the actions taken with the money accumulated. When givers
                      are able to see how their donated money is spent, campaigns would have a stronger impact.</li>

                    <li><strong> Blockchain for Charity Fundraising: Behind the Buzzword -</strong> With
                      well-established digital
                      currencies charities are now able to engage with newer category of donors. Fundraising platforms
                      are able to accept cryptocurrencies, which offer charities several benefits. Charities can track &
                      trace donations bringing in complete transparency. Payments from across the world can be accepted,
                      eliminating foreign exchange fee. It enables trading in non-geographic currency which would be a
                      major benefit for charities located in some of the world’s difficult parts. Already, several major
                      charities started accepting these currencies. Major names like Salvation Army and UNICEF have
                      registered on platforms like cryptogivingtuesday.org for accepting cryptos like Ethereum and
                      Bitcoin among others. Charities including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Breast
                      Cancer Support in the UK are also accepting digital currencies. The verifiable transactions trail
                      of Blockchain makes funds usage highly transparent. Donors would be able to track what they have
                      donated. There are also platforms now that can use Blockchain for mining the unused computing
                      capacity of donors and convert it into money for charities. An example is the Give Byte platform.
                      There is also much research underway for developing new cryptocurrency applications for charities.
                      BitGive for instance, collaborated with the University of Edinburgh, for development of such
                      applications. All these indicate the growing interest worldwide in developing blockchain use cases
                      for charities. Nonetheless, the concept of cryptocurrencies for charities has its own drawbacks
                      foremost among which is the lack of awareness around the technology. The RNLI was the first
                      charity to adopt the digital currency, way back in the year 2014, and admitted to facing several
                      obstacles in accepting donations because of their price volatilities. Such price volatility makes
                      it hard for charities to create and execute any plans around the currencies’ value. However, the
                      volatility at the same time can work for the benefit of both charities and the givers. Currency
                      appreciation for instance, can allow donors to donate the purchased cryptocurrencies at lower
                      prices, leaving the charities with the appreciating price advantage. Cryptocurrencies and
                      blockchain may be mysterious to most people even now but the interest in them is growing. In the
                      years ahead, more individual charities would also come to accept them.</li>
                    <li><strong> Digital Marketing for Nonprofit Fundraisers -</strong> Digital fundraising implies
                      building an online
                      community for raising money. It follows pretty much the same rules as the offline fundraising but
                      there are no appeal or project style approaches. Similar to how digital marketing works, digital
                      fundraising is all about attracting the target person, with the most appropriate message, at the
                      most opportune time. Digital fundraising represents targeting specific people using specific
                      messages for ultimately personalizing for them, the overall experience of donation for a cause. It
                      is basically the cycle of attracting and nurturing people and finally converting them into donors.
                      It is fluid and continuous and not segmented as projects. Digital fundraising comes in different
                      forms – peer-2-peer fundraising, social sharing of messages and campaigns, online crowdfunding,
                      special events, and interactive online among others. It is in many ways similar to digital
                      marketing in that it involves telling stories, leveraging and engaging peer networks with
                      community, building relations and transmitting to them right messages at the right time.
                      SEO is the basic concept in digital marketing for organizations. It makes their websites rank high
                      in the searches for words or phrases connecting to that organization. For charities, a similar SEO
                      strategy can translate into more donations. It can get more visitors to their website. NPOs must
                      therefore brainstorm their key phrases and implement SEO practices for improving results. Another
                      strategy is to use email newsletter. This is an important way of bringing potential donors into
                      the subsequent stage in digital fundraising, that of nurturing. Personalized emails can be more
                      effective in acquiring donors. NPOs can reach potential donors for telling them about their
                      organization through emails. An email newsletter can be sent at regular intervals for building the
                      audience. Graphic updates can be provided for making known to the receiver about all that is
                      happening in the NPO including the ongoing campaigns. Receivers must also be able to easily
                      subscribe. Prompts or pop-ups can be used in key places throughout the newsletter helping them
                      subscribe.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Non-profit fundraisers can also effectively use social media sites. Seeing names of
                      organizations on the sites would encourage givers to become part of such communities. However,
                      fundraisers must first decide presence in which sites would make more sense for their
                      organization. For Instagram for instance, good graphics and images would be necessary. NPOs must
                      also keep their social media accounts up-to-date and active always. They must be able to respond
                      immediately to comments. Mixing content can also be an effective strategy. Some of the content can
                      be for promoting services and programs of the organization while the other content can be for
                      seeking donations. There must always be a good amount of content that offers something for free,
                      for followers. It can be in the form of educational information, interesting or fun content about
                      the organization, ways to become connected with the community or even tricks and tips. Social
                      media tales evoke the necessary emotion in people about causes and once the donors have become
                      engaged emotionally, they must be told the subsequent steps reaching up to the actual donation.
                      Fundraisers must also ensure that their social media pages could be found easily on their websites
                      and in their newsletters. Social media ads can also be used. Having business pages on social media
                      sites can be helpful. Non-profit fundraisers are also required to well manage their data using the
                      best data management systems. The data they capture can help streamline their efforts of
                      fundraising. Fundraisers would be able to create engagement opportunities that would be
                      donor-specific. Information like the occupation, average gift amount and frequency of donating
                      among others can help fundraisers determine aspects such as how to ask and how much to expect.
                      Data also enables fundraisers to segment donors and prioritize fundraising efforts. <br /> <br />

                      Shifting to social fundraising would also be essential for non-profits going forward.
                      Advertising was compelled to evolve more rapidly in the recent years with the average span of
                      human attention dropping to eight seconds, an all-time low. Fundraising efforts are expected to
                      evolve similarly for building audience. The number of clicks reaching up to the donation must
                      reduce. They can be no more than five clicks in order to sustain user interest. People today
                      intend to make donations where they are, which is in the social medial networks. Too arduous a
                      donation process or the one requiring way too many clicks, fundraisers would risk losing donor
                      interest. In addition to minimizing donor journey, the social network content in the surrounding
                      also offers fundraisers the opportunities of educating and influencing people while they are
                      trying to make a donation. For all these benefits therefore, non-profits are required to shift to
                      digital-first, social fundraising. However, non-profits generally resist this shift because it
                      compels them to let go of some amount of control they so far had. They would now be at the mercy
                      of the ever-changing algorithms of social networks. Non-profits therefore are required to become
                      comfortable with social fundraising first if they are to see more money for their charity
                      projects. Furthermore, social media cannot just be used for building online communities but also
                      to capture recurring donations. It helps in keeping participants engaged through hosting repeat
                      events for fundraising. It can thus help create more predictable and also consistent revenue
                      streams. Using capabilities of messaging automation in social media chats can also be impactful in
                      personalizing interactions. Facebook Messenger and such others can be especially valuable, with
                      their higher open rates. Recipients typically enjoy the quick intakes and short content bursts
                      provided. However, notwithstanding the vehicle selected, the messaging must be highly
                      personalized. Non-profits can thus leverage social media and its inherent powers to the fullest
                      for enabling friction free giving, repeatability of giving, and also personalization of messages.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong> Fundraisers to Target Gen-Zers & Millennials -</strong> Going forward, fundraisers
                      would target
                      Gen-Zers in addition to millennials for donations. These next-generation givers would change the
                      landscape of funds giving for charity and other related purposes. Both generations grew up being
                      told by adults about how they could make the world a better place to live by giving. Now adults,
                      this population would show that belief in action. However, these people belonging to these
                      generations have high regard for their time. Time for them is money. Non-profit fundraisers
                      therefore must understand the differences between the inspirations for baby boomers and the
                      millennials and Gen Zers and adopt the most appropriate donor engagement strategies. The
                      expectations of these new generations are different and fundraisers are required to offer them
                      multiple ways for becoming engaged. They must be given payment options that include credit and
                      debit cards and other online options. The website must be eye-catching and mobile friendly.
                      Younger donors must be given the opportunity to share the fundraiser’s mission with family and
                      friends. This would expand the donor base for the non-profit. They must also be given volunteering
                      opportunities which helps build a longer-lasting relationship of an organization with a donor.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong> Leveraging Data -</strong> Non-profits would also leverage the increasing amount of
                      data for
                      philanthropy. They would use ML and predictive analytics for measuring the extent and impact of
                      their reach. Technologies would also be used for personalizing giving experience for donors.
                      Donors’ communication preferences and interests would be taken into consideration and personalized
                      messages created for developing stronger relationships with the organizations. </li>
                    <li><strong> Privacy of Donors Becomes Key -</strong> Donor privacy would also be given due
                      significance in the
                      years ahead. In 2021, the Mail Privacy Protection Policy was launched by Apple. Prior to this
                      policy, it was possible for non-profits to collect engagement data pertaining to their email
                      campaigns through inserting few hidden pixels in the body of the email so that when they are
                      opened, the pixels would be loaded allowing the host of the mail to see that it was opened. It
                      also revealed the type of devices used for opening the email and the IP address of the recipient.
                      The IP address offered the estimated location of the recipient, up to the level of the city. The
                      new policy of privacy protection however, prevented email marketers from tracking data points.
                      Non-profits therefore are required to seek alternative metrics for assessing their email campaign
                      results and they are trying to use click rate, unsubscribe rate and conversion rate among others,
                      which provide them with a broader overview of their campaigns’ performance. Such policies focused
                      on increasing donor privacy are compelling non-profits to seek alternative measurement methods.
                      Non-profits have also been adapting to the practice of cleaning out the unsubscribed and bounced
                      email addresses, which leaves them with the most engaged audience. </li>
                    <li><strong> Flexible Giving & Participation Gains Importance -</strong> Another trend that would be
                      huge over the
                      coming years would be that of flexible participation and giving. The pandemic brought forth many
                      changes to the ways people interacted with businesses, especially non-profits. Donors are
                      currently expecting organizations to provide them options for participating from the comfort and
                      safety of their homes. Several donors have over the past two years moved online and the trend
                      would continue. Also, when flexibility is offered, donors could be enticed to donate more. Over
                      the past two years, the way events for fundraising were held also changed. Events were held mostly
                      online. However, going forward, non-profits are likely to follow a hybrid fundraising event model
                      using a blend of in-person and virtual. </li>
                    <li><strong> Focus on Donor Acquisition & Retention -</strong> Non-profits would also focus more on
                      donor retention
                      in addition to donor acquisition, going forward. More than 70 percent of the donors give only
                      once, to any organization, leaving non-profits with huge losses on their first investments on
                      acquiring donors. The organizations therefore would focus on strategies for keeping individuals
                      motivated for repeat and consistent donations. New technologies and tools for fundraising
                      developed in the recent years are currently making it simpler for non-profits to enhance donor
                      experiences for improved donor retention. The tools are allowing donors to easily access
                      information about movement of their donations thus eliminating barriers to make repeat donations
                      for the organization. It is now possible to share impact reports with donors. These reports
                      demonstrate the work being carried out by the non-profits. However, non-profits are required to
                      calculate their giver retention rate, time to time, for understanding effectiveness of strategies
                      thus far and if any changes are needed for reaching the set goals. Finally, donor retention is
                      achieved mainly through building strong relationships in which the donors are appreciated for
                      their generosity. Appreciation increases donor retention rate and sustains success for fundraising
                      of a non-profit. Non-profit fundraisers would also develop programs for monthly giving for
                      creating for themselves a sustainable and predictable revenue stream. Younger donors are more
                      attuned to such monthly giving because such giving can be managed easily and can be more
                      impactful.</li>
