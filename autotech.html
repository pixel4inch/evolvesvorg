Having already reached stage 2 of autonomy, the aim is to reach stage 5 in the future. An autonomous or driverless vehicle operates itself to perform all necessary functions devoid of human intervention, by way of its ability to appropriately sense its operating environment. The vehicle uses a completely automated system for driving to enable it in responding to any external condition which an average human driver can manage also. AVs can be autonomous only when they are able to take decisions. The technology on which AVs are based is algorithms, which determine the course of performance or activity in a given situation. Vehicle technology that is autonomous can provide great advantages when compared with human-driven vehicles. The principal advantage is increased road safety because car crashes lead to the untimely deaths of thousands annually worldwide, and here, an automated vehicle can potentially decrease such casualties as their software makes lesser numbers of errors when compared with humans. </li>
                <li>Automotive HMI - The automotive industry is waking up to the importance of HMI against the backdrop of the industry’s rapid migration towards an autonomous, shared, connected, electric and service (ASCES) oriented future. Integration of infotainment systems in passenger cars as standard vehicle fixtures which include embedded entertainment, communication, navigation and telematics modules require additional non-driving interaction with car, thus influencing demand for HMI solutions. HMI plays a vital role in safe use of in-vehicle connected services such as emergency services, latest and current up-to-date traffic, stock quotes, weather alerts, music streaming etc. HMI is therefore integral to the success of the automotive industry’s transformation towards digital mobility. Automotive HMI is expected to witness robust growth supported by technology developments that make HMI systems that are easy to operate, more sophisticated, provide greater comfort, ease of mind, and minimize driver distraction. The market is forecast to benefit from the development of new next generation HMI input technologies like touchscreens, voice control, gesture control, etc. given their ability to enable a low-distraction user interface. Gesture recognition especially is being used for controlling infotainment systems. They are also being used for controlling lights and for GPS navigation. </li>

The decentralized ledger of Blockchain technology would enable driverless cars to access the needed traffic data, in the real-time and also in the most accurate manner. Furthermore, the smart contracts that are enabled by the technology can simplify several other aspects related to driving, including insurance payments, and payments for tools, repairs etc. Centralization increases vulnerability of data and there is also this inability to rapidly communicate between data points, reducing its worth in real-time scenarios. The status quo however, can be improved by Blockchain technology. Blockchain enables a more efficient and rapid spread of data for autonomous vehicles. Establishing decentralized networks which transfer data more seamlessly, to all the points, constitutes the first step towards creating a safer ecosystem of driverless vehicles. Another application for Blockchain technology in autonomous cars, which holds immense promise, is in improving transactions occurring between vehicles and infrastructure surrounding them. An area where Blockchain would be likely deployed would be V2V microtransactions. Car owners would be allowed to use tokens for paying for data needed from other vehicles. Such data can be anything from weather forecasts, congestion data, gas prices etc. Vehicles would thus be made to earn tokens by sharing data. They could also sell data to manufacturers and advertisers. Blockchain in these strategies would be critical for creating the ecosystem of V2V data sharing, which rewards and incentivizes participation.</li>
                <li>Automotive AI – AI is offering massive support to the automotive industry by enabling development of Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous vehicles.

This is because before autonomous cars can become a reality, communication and data analytics need to evolve to overcome safety issues of a driverless future. Auto OEMs are already partnering with MNOs to provide vehicle information, driving characteristics, driver behavior analysis, location information, and OTA updates. Vehicle specific information, for instance, can be broadcasted by MNOs within and beyond the direct V2V communication range. Also known as WLAN-based V2X, DSRC uses radio communication provided by 802.11p. There are strong and clearly visible signs of C-V2X gaining momentum globally with the latest in the string of developments being the integration of C-V2X into Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ Automotive 4G/5G platforms. 5G based C-V2X has also arrived as a powerful unified connectivity fabric to expand applications and performance. With fiber-like data speeds; low latency for real-time interactivity; consistently superior performance, massive capacity for unlimited data transport, 5G is the new game changer for V2X. 5G based C-V2X opens the doors for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) and provides high data rate needed to support higher levels of predictability which is vital for autonomous driving. This in itself has set the V2X market on an accelerated growth path. Several RSU & OBU products are currently in pipeline while at the same time the global footprint to support system integration is getting better, bigger and smarter. There is robust activity from standards completion to independent field testing to early commercialization.</li>
                <li>Electric Vehicles (EV) - EV sales by 2027 is expected to more than double driven by robust policy support among governments worldwide in the form of subsidies and incentives for EVs, investments in charging infrastructure, and phase-out internal combustion engines. Stringent emission regulations are encouraging auto OEMs to electrify their fleets at a pace much faster than policy targets. The number of EV models available on the market is expected to grow significantly from the 450 models currently available, underpinning the effervescent and continuous level of technology innovation and research and development activities underway.
