                    <p>Innovation holds an important place in today’s highly competitive business environment and the global healthcare market is no exception to this. Innovations have a disruptive impact on the overall medical device industry. Generally advancements in the medtech space result from significant collaborations, where the role of contract manufacturers continues to grow in prominence as OEMs increasingly adopt outsourcing strategy for production operations. Advanced technology concepts such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), IoT, Cloud computing, Big Data, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) are likely to improve and augment the contract manufacturing landscape in the coming years. With precision manufacturing taking center stage in the medical device vertical, technologies that fully support the concept are being increasingly sought by contract manufacturers across the board, while spurring the adoption of AI and RPA powered production lines. The development of innovative medical devices entails significant complexities, and requires tremendous investments in time, efforts and cost on part of the medical device company. Almost all medical devices, regardless of the level of associated complexity, involve several complicated stages starting from idea generation stage to the final launch of the product in the market. Device manufacturers attempt to focus on continuous innovation in technologies to justify higher margin. Rapid technological obsolescence and technical parity within competing devices makes time-to-market critical for most of the device product lines. When technical innovation occurs, older technologies will be used in commodity items while new technologies fuel growth through premium pricing strategies. Therefore, OEMs are accelerating product developments and are treading new paths to get their products to more quickly to market, in order to gain first mover advantages. Drug-device combinations (DDCs), Preventive and predictive healthcare, and self-care, self-management are some of the key focus areas for medical devices looking to launch innovative products.</p>
