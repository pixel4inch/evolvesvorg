                      <p class=" m-0">A number of high impact technologies have helped make the metaverse dream a
                        reality. A few of the noteworthy enabling technologies are discussed below.</p>
                      <br />
                      <ul>
                        <li> <strong>AR/VR/MR/XR - </strong> AR and VR especially stand out for their instrumental role
                          in powering the future metaverse. Being major Immersive technologies that work by overlaying a
                          digital layer of experience over daily reality, AR and VR have revolutionized the way we
                          interact and experience the virtual world. Rapid advancements and improvements have helped
                          create immersive alternate reality that today is helping form the foundation for the
                          metaverse. Defined as a digital representation of oneself, the use of avatar will
                          revolutionize the world of communication, not just in the social media space but also in the
                          field of enterprise collaboration and communication. Meta’s business agenda behind the
                          purchase of Oculus Rift is to create and monetize the use of electronic avatars. Fruition of
                          the technology’s promised capabilities will result in over 1 billion people spending an
                          increasing portion of their time wearing, managing and controlling their electronic avatars.
                          VR is therefore forecast to emerge as a multidisciplinary communication tool in social
                          networking, the ad industry, and in the telecommunication industry. In the emerging field of
                          metaverse, VR headsets and AR glasses will provide the ability to virtually live in this
                          parallel alternate reality universe.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) - </strong> Publishers always want their users to
                          return and continue investing, while also growing with a particular environment. Tools like AI
                          that gather audience information for learning and understanding the audience wll be largely
                          responsible for the Metaverse’s growth in the next frontier of the gaming industry. AI has
                          already become an inextricable part of daily work and living and assists with the testing,
                          checking, coding and even automatic generation of whole story segments. With more people
                          becoming creators of digital content, it is expected that AI will assume the role of a
                          creative aide which will work with human creators and automate repetitive, difficult, or
                          boring tasks which form a part of any creative process. AI systems learn from previous
                          patterns and examples seen in a Metaverse, subsequently using this learnt information in
                          assisting with the newer creative processes. Additionally, AI has a significant role to play
                          in the Metaverse because AI systems in future will identify and know users, thus, shaping
                          their individual Metaverse-related experiences accordingly. </li>
                        <li> <strong>Digital Twins – </strong>This technology will help people in moving between virtual
                          and real spaces. Digital twins are the building blocks of metaverse and use intelligent edge
                          and intelligent cloud to create digital models running from simple assets to complex
                          environments. Metaverse is a network of digital spaces used in virtual-reality worlds and
                          video-game environments. Digital twins can be seen as clones of real-world systems and objects
                          and can be used to develop, evolve or design our cities. </li>
                        <li> <strong>Edge Computing & 5G - </strong>Edge computing is rapidly emerging as a technology
                          innovation that can be widely adopted across industries. Some of key benefits of using
                          intelligent edge include capability for quick decision making and low latency. Edge meets
                          local computing requirements as data is processed in micro-data centers. On-site data
                          processing helps to eliminate latency and address network and connectivity challenges. Every
                          edge computing unit would have dedicated storage, computer and network system. When coupled
                          with 5G, there is strong potential to considerably lower network latency. Edge computing and
                          5G would support situational awareness along with data analysis for on-spot decision making.
                          Cognitive intelligence and autonomous decision-making reduce processing as well as decision
                          making latency. The approach allows faster and almost real-time decisions. The evolution of
                          edge analytics and 5G beyond conventional descriptive analytics is expected to provide users
                          with the ability to predict, take appropriate actions, and learn from past behavioral patterns
                          for enhanced decisions. The availability and processing of more data delivered by 5G is
                          anticipated to help edge analytics in generating meaningful insights, improving the decision
                          making process and supporting applications related to cognitive intelligence. Edge computing
                          along with 5G will therefore enable users to engage meaningfully in the metaverse and enjoy a
                          truly immersive experience.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Blockchain - </strong> As the stride towards metaverse intensifies, blockchains are
                          slated to don an integral role in ascribing authenticity to electronic transactions, both for
                          fungible and non-fungible tokens. NFTs are emerging as integral to gaming, especially for
                          monetizing user-created content and for secure transactions across the platform.
                          Cryptocurrencies that possess standard valuation are substitutable for each other while
                          non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are exclusive digital assets created by individuals for trading
                          across platforms with unique valuation and cannot be interchanged in terms of value. With the
                          popularity of NFTs surging, the road ahead for blockchain metaverse is brimming with
                          possibilities riding on the popularity of metaverse rush across the globe. NFTs range from art
                          works, GIFs, images, music, videos to any other digital content that commands value. The
                          uniqueness of this asset class is akin to copyrights where the ownership is vested in
                          individuals who create and assign value independently. NFTs across blockchain platforms are
                          emerging as the foundation for creating virtual worlds that are popularizing play to earn
                          concept. In other words, a player can earn revenue by selling the characters or tokens earned
                          through gaming. As such, gamers are touted to be the early adopters of metaverse owing to
                          their comfort levels in navigating within the virtual space and ability to communicate across
                          the gaming environment. Another key tenet in metaverse is the portability of 3D avatars and
                          digital assets across the interoperating platforms. Blockchain enables the digital movement
                          and tracking of resources and NFTs owned by individuals across the metaverse.</li>

                          most efficiently in order to perform well in organic search traffic and excel in SEO rankings.
                          Images represent the most effective form of any content. For any brand, a better understanding
                          of the content through the optimal quality of images is key to becoming a bigger influencer.
                          Games are the major means through which brands are entering into the virtual space, where they
                          could natively insert themselves into the world of experiences, rather than interrupting them.

                        <li> <strong>Manufacturing in the Metaverse to Hit Prime Time - </strong> The metaverse is
                          anticipated to wield a major impact on manufacturing in the future. While the approach of
                          digital-first is driven by actions and preferences of the consumer, in the metaverse,
                          consumers would become the creators and designers. They would create new demand and also
                          change how products are made. Designing of production processes would become rapid in the
                          metaverse helped by better virtual spaces that simulate production processes of facility.
                          Business owners would be able to witness quickly, how moving specific assets around could
                          impact production. Car manufacturers have already started using it for simulating their
                          manufacturing facilities and were able to plan production processes more accurately. BMW is an
                          example. Real physics can thus be simulated and ways for making work safer and more efficient
                          can be identified, without actually having to stop or slow down production for achieving the
                          same results achieved using physical changes or testing. The general public would be given the
                          ability to simulate 3D prototypes of products which would render more people to create, just
                          like how the YouTube channel has numerous content creators. Creators and designers will no
                          longer be required to go through intermediaries for getting their creations to manufacturers
                          and this will help increase number of designs exponentially. Product design will also become
                          increasingly collaborative and rapid due to availability of specialized tools. </li>
                        <li> <strong>Future of Work Will Shift from WFH to WFM - </strong> The future of work is remote
                          and online communication. Metaverse will go a long way in reshaping the digital economy by
                          opening up the possibility of the ‘infinite office’. Emerging technologies have transformed
                          traditional working. Virtual reality will be harnessed not only for gaming and entertainment
                          but also for creating a shared virtual space. Digital companies are racing towards this
                          digital frontier that will transform the future of the workplace and work itself. The Horizon
                          Workrooms from Facebook is a VR avatar of virtual meeting space. Be it Roblox, Minecraft,
                          Fortnite, or the other metaverse players, several billion users are being introduced to a new
                          virtual office experience from home. Each tech giant is building its own metaverse. The
                          Infinite office will revolutionize the work-from-home concept. Users can develop and share
                          collaborative projects, play games, and socialize. They can attend concerts, shop, purchase
                          houses, and play video games. While AR and VR technologies have been used by astronauts,
                          soldiers, and surgeons, other industries like customer service, retail, and logistics are on
                          the threshold of employing them. With metaverse products, people can be more productive by
                          reducing duplication of effort and promoting collaborative working. Metaverse will open up new
                          vistas of work and interaction. Freelancing and remote working will become easier with virtual
                          options. Management can monitor employees more effectively.</li>
