                  <p class=" m-0">Digital fashion is increasingly been viewed as a sustainable substitute for the disposable culture that was largely spread by fast fashion. Thanks to digital fashion garments or clothing can exist exclusively on a metaverse or in a digital area instead of in a physical form. Digital fashion minimizes wastage of any form and enables shoppers to engage in all the ongoing trends and experiment with varied styles and outfits without causing any damage to the environment. The metaverse offers a creative and innovative space that allows individuals to express their exquisite individuality and style in a way that may be implausible to attain in the actual physical world. Digital samples enhance sustainability and reduce lead time by cutting down on the required number of samples for visualizing designs. The technology offers increased flexibility to the designers by enabling them to try innumerable variabilities of innovative materials and styling. Many leading fashion labels and designers such as Balenciaga and Burberry are focusing on digital fashion and developing various novel digital products. </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p class=" m-0">The industry is witnessing effervescent activity and energy ranging from showcasing the designers' creations, e-commerce, gaming, and virtual catwalk shows to the metaverse. The latest developments in the technological field is enabling the fashion industry to grow resiliently and is providing designers with various new opportunities to test and trial with designs utilizing specialist software packages such as Clo3D, Unreal Engine, Autodesk Maya, and Adobe Substance Suite.  Clo3D provides a very innate way of designing and comes equipped with a wide array of trims and fabrics that enables designers to try out their designs. Designers can tailorize and design their own trims and fabrics for developing digital samples. The very accurate and realistic 3D clothing makes the task much easier to mend and rebuild the fit of the designs even for drape-sensitive fabrics such as jerseys and lightweight wovens. Clo3D software enables the designers to view and revise their designs from 3D point of view and adds life to the designs with photorealistic animations or renderings. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">The rise of virtual models and 3D fashion models has enhanced the design workflow and established new standards for the creation of fashion designs in a much faster and more practical way. 2D-3D creation tools and digital fashion design have been gathering momentum among environmentally conscious designers and fashion labels who aim to minimize the impact on the environment. Developing digital fashion designs in a virtual software environment is the initial step in fashion digitization, and not solely developing digital content for use in fashion presentations on social media with actual garments. 3D digital clothing mainly focuses on reducing all the unwarranted and needless physical samples and waste that is generated because of fittings or cuttings. Rectification of design faults on the move, reducing lead times, and cutting down on production time are some of the advantages of virtual garments. </p>


                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Companies are faced with the necessity to develop risk-minimizing policies which can be executed quickly as government regulations, fiscal policies and conflicts rise. Besides, the companies need to evaluate the areas where they function, and reconsider the top-line growth potential while assessing new as well as existing international markets. Consumers are likely to be more indecisive and inconsistent in the years to come, and hence companies are required to take into consideration all the factors that are likely to affect the shopping pattern and behave accordingly. Companies can keep customers engaged despite reduced spending through off-price retailers and rental channels. However, such strategies need to be carefully executed for ensuring that company reputation and brand margins are safeguarded. Brands, on the other hand, are will be required to refurbish their design and merchandising strategies for addressing changing ideas around dress codes and gender lines in fashion. Despite the economic turmoil, fashion labels today are in a very unique position to reexamine the ways their brands manufacture, distribute as well as promote their products. Supply chains are not disrupted by the recent pandemic, enhancing the need to capitalize on quicker and geographically closer production units. Digital channels and direct-to-consumer will continue to be a priority, however, fashion labels need to expand their sales channels for improving market relevance and efficiency. Companies also need to continue to be unique and creative in their marketing efforts for luring customers via bold and exclusive content that stands out in the cluttered digital environment. The future outlook for the fashion industry is fragile and ambiguous. Moving ahead, industry players are required to make appropriate strategic decisions and invest in creativity and agility and succeed whenever the market bounces back. </p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Many of the top-notch retailers are out of business because of the absence of any uniqueness and novelty. In order to sustain themselves in the market, companies are required to focus on consumer engagement, sustainability, and digital platforms. The use of AI can help in minimizing the shopping challenges for fashion online and AR can add newness and innovative experiences to the physical store by providing customers with engaging ways to shop. Fashion technology in the new era is also eco-friendly helping the fashion industry to minimize its impact on the environment by developing eco-friendly materials, optimizing manufacturing processes to cut down on wastage, and reducing harmful emissions. Some of the innovations in technology have the potential to influence the future of the fashion industry and make it a more eco-friendly, kinder, and ethical industry. Besides, technology, governments need to ensure that the brands are sustainable and ethical, and the consumption habits and actions of the consumers are all crucial for ensuring that the fashion industry has minimal impact on the environment. Growing efficiency on production lines, sensor technology, and robots roaming factory floors are helping fashion labels to monitor stock as and when it gets transported across the world. AI technology on the other hand works as a personal shopping online as well as an in-store assistant for customers. Artificial intelligence is helping brands optimize their production lines, AR is augmenting the customer experience, and VR is developing potential novel revenue-earning opportunities.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Novel Fabrics and Material Innovation -</strong> Materials are a very crucial part of the fashion and clothing industry. Novel fabrics are undoubtedly the future of the fashion industry and will enable designers to appeal to customers as being sustainable and differentiating from the competition. Non-biodegradable and synthetic fibers are utilized in nearly 72% of the garments that are manufactured today. Novel fabrics enable designers to get innovative and artistic and develop sustainable materials. Developing sustainable fabrics will aid in reducing the production of materials that are developed using non-biodegradable fibers and plastics. Besides, animals can also be saved from being killed as the innovation will enable apparel manufacturers to develop eco-friendly silk, fur, and leather without the need for any animals. Companies such as Modern Meadow are developing products utilizing lab-grown leather without making use of any animal's skin. Similarly, other companies such as EntoGenetics and Bolt Threads are developing highly strong spider silk. Likewise, technology giant, Google, is also developing project Jacquard, which is being developed out of the company’s Advanced Technology and Projects Lab, which is an assortment of conductive threads for weaving touch-responsive textiles such as rugs, tablecloths, clothing, or anything else that is made using fabric.</li>
                    <li><strong>Innovative Eco-Materials -</strong> The fashion industry is investing largely in closed-loop recycling systems for minimizing wastage. Technological developments are offering several ways for enhancing the sustainability of fashion, from providing eco-friendly dyeing methods to lab-developed sustainable material choices for fashion manufacture. Gucci for instance is trying to explore live-stock free, eco-friendly materials, and Lululemon and Hermès are trying to use mycelium, a material that is developed from fungus, as a substitute for leather. With packing claiming a considerable share of plastic fashion manufacture per year, companies are increasingly offering packing that customers can compost at home, offering rich nutrients back to the earth. </li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Influencers Gaining Popularity -</strong> Social media influencers have gained immense popularity in the fashion industry in the last couple of years. Virtual influencers are completely virtual personalities that are developed on social media channels with the main focus of selling clothes and other products.  Many fashion labels make use of these influencers for marketing their products. Some of the benefits of virtual influencers are that the pictures can be taken and products or items can be styled as per the company’s requirements, and the brands do not have to fear about lack of cooperation or damaging behavior from the influencer. However, some consumers find presentations from these influencers very unrealistic, overly curated, and too perfect. Companies are making use of synthetic media in the way of computer-generated characters which can imitate human influencers on the social media platform.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Fashion -</strong> Digital-native consumers are purchasing virtual fashion- intangible garments which they can purchase and wear in online or the virtual world. Ralph Lauren, for instance, introduced a virtual store on Roblox, where brands can buy digital garments that are stimulated by real-world designs. </li>
<li><strong>Live Streaming -</strong> Social media in today’s era is offering innumerable opportunities for fashion labels to establish connections with their probable customers. Sales through social media platforms are likely to boost in the near future, which is expected to be driven by ‘live commerce’ sales where companies sell their products directly to consumers via broadcast events instantly on social media. </li>
<li><strong>Mobile Commerce and Fashion Applications -</strong> As consumers are spending more and more of their time on tablets and mobile phones, the fashion industry is taking advantage of this and is developing various applications as well as mobile tech. Developing apps makes it very easy for fashion labels to establish connections with customers. Vinted and Depop are some examples of fashion markets where in shoppers can sell or purchase clothes. Clothes renting apps such as On Loan and By Rotation have also been gaining immense popularity in the last few years. </li>
<li><strong>Rise of 3D Software -</strong> A new generation of fashion labels and fashion designers is growing across the world, which is recreating the conventional ready-to-wear model and making it into eco-friendly, precise, and visually appealing. The new generation of designers is also trying to learn all the new digital skills and deliver the actual change for the fashion supply chain. Today, there is a wide variety available in specialized software for 3D creation, including Marvelous Designer, Optitex, and LO3D programs among others. Digital pattern-making programs such as Lectra or Geber Technology are also available as transversal industry design tools for the furniture, fashion, and automotive sectors. Fashion designers today can develop, alter, change and revise fashion apparel in much lesser time as compared to the conventional methods, produce virtual samples in just hours and work as a team even remotely. Designers can also design garments utilizing virtual fabrics and modify and tailor the finishes and lengths, making fittings for even virtual avatars. For instance, Balmain has recently unveiled a completely virtual showroom, Final Fantasy and Louis Vuitton have partnered for creating digital garments, Carlings has developed a virtual collection that is applied to the customers’ photographs, and The Fabricant, a Dutch-based company develops digital-only apparel and products that are in high demand in virtual gaming platforms. Taking all these developments into consideration, future fashion designers are likely to deal with a very high level of hybridization between the digital world and the actual world and uncover and develop novel ways of converting the design process.</li>

                  <br />

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) -</strong> Simulating human intelligence by machines or computers is artificial intelligence (AI), which is one of the greatest and key technologies that is being used across various industries and not only fashion. Many of the fashion companies today have been using AI for broad array of applications, such as identifying purchasing patterns, understanding fashion aesthetics, analyzing and forecasting trends and improving customers experiences. Besides, the fashion companies are also utilizing AI for getting information relating to inventory, improve sales, predict future trends and many others. Companies are installing touchscreens and chatbots inside the stores for delivering tailored product advice and enhancing customer experience. AI’s technology consists of various algorithms that can monitor the customers’ journey in order to suggest them appropriate products. Today almost all the fashion brands make use of AI chat technology for augmenting their customers’ experience. For instance touch screens are installed in the retail shops for providing tailored product suggestions to the customers with the help of AI technology. AI can be schooled to identify various aesthetics, including style, color and texture preferences. In addition to customer service technology, supply chain management, and trend prediction are some other areas that offer lucrative business opportunities for AI.  Real-time tracking of inventory stocks is very crucial for companies as this not only makes warehouse operations as well as management efficient but it also saves lot of time. If inventory tracking is integrated AI’s data prediction tools for predicting the trends, then the companies can have major competitive advantage. Conventional ways of trend prognosis consist of observation and collection of data from trend spotters, influencers, and fashion designers. However, with AI technology companies have instant access to all the information that enables them to plan correct styles as well as quantities in time. 
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

Similarly, many of the eyewear brands such as Glasses Direct and Firmoo are also enabling the customers to digitally try out their glasses prior to purchasing. All the latest technologies display how AI is the future of fashion industry and is shaping right from predicting trends to how consumers can view and purchase the products.

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR) -</strong> Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) is another popular technology that is making rapid waves in the fashion industry. While VR includes a completely simulated environment, AR on the other hand adds simulations and interactivity in the real-world environment. VR and AR are two exciting technologies for the fashion sector, as they enable to combine the digital and physical worlds of the retail. VR technology is largely used in the fashion industry for enabling the customers to try out the clothes virtually, the technology is also used for developing a VR version of a complete store. </li>
                    <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) -</strong> Augmented reality technology allows to cover digital objects over the real world, where customers can interact instantly. Today, a large percentage of customers intend to shop more with the companies that are incorporated with AR, as this technology offers exciting and engaging experiences to the customers. AR is estimated to be largely used for virtual try-on.  </li>
                    <li><strong>3D Printing -</strong> 3D printing is a manufacturing process where actual products can be developed from digital designs. The technology allows complicated digital designs to be accurately printed by a machine, thus reducing any kind of wastage of resources and manufacturing faults. The usage of 3D printing also helps in reducing the wastage of textiles, wastage of water, and minimizes contamination of water and air pollution.  3D printing also provides numerous choices to the designer in terms of fabric, creativity, and clothing structure. The technology enables fashion labels to improve their customization and meet sustainability goals. 3D printing, however, is currently being used only to show pieces. But the technology is gaining momentum in the fashion industry, and more and more labels are relying on technology and novelty for becoming more sustainable in the market. </li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain -</strong> This is another novel technology that is transforming the way businesses are conducted in the fashion industry. A blockchain is a long-lasting and irreversible database that enables to record the transactions and tracking the assets. Blockchain emerges as an important tool for providing efficiency and transparency in the supply chain, thus allowing all parties to exchange documents and data in a secure way. The technology also provides an exquisite digital ID to every fashion product so that these items can be tracked easily. For instance, Chanel is one of the several labels that is introducing a digital passport that via an exquisite embedded metal plate will approve the authenticity of a product. Some other labels use blockchains for enhancing transparency as consumers are increasingly looking for ethical and sustainable products. </li>
                    <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) - </strong>The IoT consists of all the products which have technology incorporated into them for enabling the products to use internet connectivity. In other words, IoT defines a network of products that are implanted with technology for enabling connection and exchange of information/ data over the internet. Fashion products and items can also fall under this category and have the potential to address to the unique and novel demands of today’s customers. This is one of the budding and stimulating technological trends that is dominating the fashion industry. Players in the fashion industry are striving hard to mirror the realities of the daily lives of customers. From being very comfortable to making use of novel and exciting fabric materials, the fashion industry is trying hard to meet the demands of the modern lifestyle of consumers. Wearable gadgets and apparel technology have made several advancements in the way customers can interact with their surroundings and bodies. Responsive sportswear, smart clothing, multi-functional designs, and wearable spaces have all undergone major transformations over the past few years. Wearability today has a whole new meaning as the consumers ‘real’ lives are increasingly being mixed with virtual ones. Advancements in technology have changed the way businesses are being conducted, IoT allows sharing of data, monitoring security, and inventory management, and increasing productivity and efficiency. IoT technology enables companies to enhance their customer experience, by enabling the customers to actually take the internet as well as data sharing with them on daily basis. IoT can be used in workout clothes for measuring an individual’s heartbeat, and in babies' clothes for identifying the baby's sleep pattern. Besides, IoT products can also offer design advice based on the customers’ actions.  For instance, Fuseprojects` power suits allow the older population suffering from muscle dystrophia to walk, stay active, and stand for long period of time. Some of famous examples of IoT include doorbells, watches, and smart lightbulbs. With the help of this technology, fashion labels can control stock and minimize loss of product during shipping by installing trackers in containers.
                      <li><strong>Synthetic Media -</strong> As AI develops fashion labels will have innumerable fashion innovations for exploration, and one such avenue is synthetic media. Synthetic media is the content developed utilizing algorithms learned from photos, text, videos, audio, and other text for creating realistic data. Companies will be able to develop content in very little time. </li>
                      <li><strong>Bio-Packaging -</strong> Online shopping forms a big part of the fashion industry, and a large percentage of the online shopping packing is made using plastics and which is easily thrown away after a single use. Bio packaging, however, can come to the rescue of this issue, as these are manufactured using renewable resources or are biodegradable, or both.</li>
