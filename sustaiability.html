                  <p class=" m-0">Governments worldwide are being pushed to the forefront of the battle against climate
                    change. Why? Because the world is now at a crucial climate crossroads. The pandemic has set into
                    motion winds of change in climate change management. Since the 1970s, humanity’s demand for
                    ecological resources and services in a given year has exceeded what the earth can regenerate in that
                    year, rising to a level where it would require an equivalent of 1.6 planets for providing resources
                    sustainably. In addition, the biodiversity index has dropped by over 50% with the populations of
                    several other species continuing to decline. Moreover, the levels of greenhouse gas emissions that
                    are responsible for climate change have nearly doubled, while the devastating effects of climate
                    change have become more evident than ever before. The world has also lost over 48% of tropical and
                    subtropical forests due to large-scale deforestation and agricultural expansion. All these
                    environmental indicators paint a grim picture that humanity is approaching environmental limits at a
                    rapid pace, which, if crossed, could cause irreversible changes. For instance, if global
                    temperatures are allowed to climb by 2°C above pre-industrial levels, feedback mechanisms would kick
                    in, leading to runaway climate change. The world is already at the halfway point of reaching this
                    limit and could even cross it over the next few decades. Failure of sustainability efforts tends to
                    increase environment risk, as observed by the recent increase in the occurrence of floods, droughts,
                    hurricanes, forest fires, and other natural disasters across the globe. Climate change is resulting
                    in an increase in global temperature, which in turn is causing glaciers to melt, as well as
                    disturbing marine species and increasing energy consumption, thus putting pressure on natural
                    resources and leading to biodiversity loss. The coming decade has to be a decade of action in order
                    to avert an impending climate catastrophe. Year 2023 will be a crucial year for businesses,
                    governments and consumers as they set a clear path for the future of our environment. By making
                    dedicated commitments and strategizing to take action, companies and consumers alike can massively
                    drive change and make an outsized impact on climate change. Year 2023 and beyond will therefore
                    become the inflection point for environmental policies and sustainability goals. Addressing
                    sustainability and setting environmental goals and laying roadmaps to achieve them will need a
                    prompt and dedicated response similar to what we have shown in battling the COVID-19 infection
                    outbreak. </p>

                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">The true meaning and flavor of sustainability involves keeping the focus squarely on
                    real-world outcomes. The concept is garnering considerable attention across countries, organizations
                    and people due to mounting pressing concerns like climate change and rapid depletion of natural
                    resources. Sustainability represents the ability to address existing requirements while preserving
                    natural resources for the future generations. The idea of sustainability goes a long way in
                    improving quality of life, protecting ecosystems and conserving natural resources for the future
                    generations. Sustainability recognizes the environment as an exhaustible resource and requires
                    serious efforts to protect it and associated resources. Sustainability also focuses on other areas,
                    including social responsibility and economic development. These areas focus on carrying capacity of
                    the Earth along with sustainability of occupations, ecosystems and behaviors. Positive efforts in
                    this direction pave way for a sustainable society, where people live in great harmony with the
                    nature and environment while conserving natural resources for future generations. In addition,
                    efforts to go sustainable and green play an important role in benefitting organizations while
                    protecting the environment. Sustainable development requires stakeholders to existing without
                    depleting resources for future. The idea of sustainability revolves around the assumption that all
                    resources are limited and must be used in a careful and conservative manner. A sustainable society
                    needs to be socially responsible, protect the environment and strive to achieve a dynamic
                    equilibrium between natural systems and humans. Sustainability holds high important owing to
                    associated short- and long-term benefits. People must make sustainable choices to maintain
                    ecosystems on the Earth. Harmful processes must be changed to prevent rapid depletion of fossil
                    fuels and other natural resources, and avoid irreversible damage to the environment and animal
                    species. Sustainability leads to quality water and clean air along with availability of resources
                    required for survival of humans and other species. Sustainability allows businesses to reduce their
                    carbon footprint, improve brand image, attract employees, and gain investments. Organizations
                    embracing sustainability are poised to gain in terms of business image and revenues. The UN has
                    published ‘The Sustainable Development Goals’ for raising awareness and driving the shift towards a
                    sustainable and better future. These goals encompass several aspects such as sustainable economic
                    growth, zero hunger, no poverty, clean and affordable energy, clean water, and responsible
                    production and consumption. Sustainability is poised to gain considerable attention owing to the
                    climate crisis, prompting businesses and people to live sustainable lives. In the coming years,
                    companies are anticipated to pay more attention to sustainable processes while limiting or
                    completely eliminating harmful emissions.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">The move towards sustainability requires transformations through various steps linked
                    with the way people and businesses produce and consume. Sustainable development represents a
                    societal and environmental challenge that requires improvements in healthcare and education to push
                    income levels for people and favouring environmental decisions. The efforts points towards the need
                    for responsible production and consumption along with focus on using fewer resources to reduce
                    demand and accelerate the shift towards circular economy. Companies in the energy industry need to
                    focus on de-carbonization efforts through renewable and clean energy options. Sustainability holds a
                    direct link with carbon emission reduction, indicating the significance to migrate from fossil fuels
                    towards green transportation options like electric vehicles to protect the environment. The
                    sustainability strategy requires consumption of sustainable foods while making efforts to protect
                    the oceans and the biosphere. Another strategy is to embrace the digital trend and move away from
                    paper-based approaches that are associated with massive deforestation. The ‘reduce, reuse and
                    recycle’ strategy is one the strongest pillars of the sustainability drive. Consumers can shift
                    attention from plastic or paper bags towards reusable bags as well as consider reusable food storage
                    containers for reducing waste. Recycling holds a significant potential to considerably reduce
                    movement of waste to landfills. The strategy drastically reduces waste and allows companies to use
                    recycled materials for lowering carbon footprint. In addition, increasing focus on recycling is
                    bound to create new employment opportunities through the budding industry.</p>

                    <li><strong>Digitalization & Sustainability -</strong> Sustainability and digitalization are two
                      most powerful influences on the present corporate landscape. Each concept has attracted massive
                      amounts of research on how to change prevalent management practices, and even more broadly, both
                      society and business. The meeting point of such trends, however, has remained a largely
                      unchartered territory. Moreover, instances of such trends that converge within an organization
                      abound, ranging from absolutely clean technologies, green production processes to projecting a
                      business’ brand equity as a company that is sustainable. Even though due attention is given to
                      such shifts individually, less importance is given to understand how such trends combine in
                      reshaping those market conditions in which companies operate. Through digitization, great
                      opportunities exist for those enterprises which realize the true value of their available data for
                      creating more sustained solutions. The overall concept of digitalization comprising artificial
                      intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and more importantly, cybersecurity, is
                      described often with hyperbole. Big data for instance, has been called the new oil or soil and the
                      ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution’s primary driver. Artificial intelligence too, is receiving
                      the same attention in this second machine age and any country controlling AI is expected to rule
                      the world. However, it has also been predicted on the contrary that full AI development could also
                      spell the human race’s end. The hype on sustainability, however, has a separate flavor because it
                      is the 21st century’s primary economic and moral imperative and a critical source of both risks
                      and opportunities for businesses. Society, nature, and business share a symbiotic and complex
                      relationship which decision-makers need to understand. Most renowned institutions like the United
                      Nations, International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board, G20, and the Roman Catholic
                      Church have supported sustainable development actively for achieving the sustainable goals of
                      development defined by the UN.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain in Sustainable Development - </strong>Growing concerns over pollution are
                      driving countries to focus on sustainability efforts and tap on emerging technologies such as
                      blockchain for ensuring a better future. Based on plethora of benefits owing to its unique
                      properties, blockchain is anticipated to play a considerable role in supporting a number of
                      environmental governance initiatives in the post-pandemic world. Blockchain is anticipated to hold
                      a vital role in the coming years, transforming existing approaches and facilitating new use cases
                      to repair environmental challenges. The technology is expected to enable sustainability
                      monitoring, verification and reporting, while helping countries to comply with existing treaties
                      related to environmental protection. Governments are investigating the role of blockchain in
                      connecting carbon accounts for enabling cross-border alliances and investments in emissions
                      reductions. The technology presents an approach to record information that is almost impossible to
                      hack or alter, paving way for transparent and sustainable business practices. By enabling highly
                      transparent supply chains, the technology is anticipated to provide customers with desirable
                      information for making informed purchasing decisions and opting for eco-friendly products.
                      Blockchain enables tokenized rewards viable to encourage participation in recycling programs.
                      Finance platforms enabled by the technology are expected to revolutionize the access to required
                      capital and attract investors for projects intended to mitigate environmental challenges, such as
                      green infrastructure programs. Emerging blockchain-powered geospatial platforms are likely to
                      create new and more efficient market practices for protecting life on the land through to ocean.
                      Blockchain is anticipated to be leveraged for promoting environmental sustainability and enabling
                      new aspects like highly efficient sustainability monitoring, advanced verification and reporting
                      of natural resources, carbon accounting, air/water pollution monitoring and disaster preparedness.
                      The technology also promotes generation of green, sustainable energy. Decentralized energy systems
                      designed for solar modules are expected to result in generation of renewable energy in an
                      efficient manner, even across areas lacking desirable infrastructures. The approach provides
                      emerging and less developed nations with the opportunity to avoid huge costs required for setting
                      conventional centralized electricity networks. The technology is expected to help governments in
                      tracking real impacts of existing environmental treaties and accordingly offer incentives to
                      industries for increasing their contribution towards sustainability. </li>
                    <li><strong>AI Powers Sustainability -</strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the capability of any
                      computer or a machine to imitate the human ability such as recognizing objects, learning from
                      experience and examples, responding to and comprehending the language, solving problems, and
                      making decisions. AI field is growing because of heavy investments and big organizations that have
                      substantial ecological footprints that utilize AI in making the companies' activities more
                      sustainable. Machine learning maximizes energy production and demand instantly, enables enhanced
                      grid systems with increased efficiency and predictability, and renewable energy usage. Smart
                      meters and sensors are deployed inside the buildings to gather data, for analyzing, optimizing
                      energy usage, and monitoring in buildings. Smart transport is using AI such as Waze and Google
                      maps, in which machine learning algorithms are utilized to enhance navigation, offer information
                      about traffic congestion and flows, and increase safety. AI-enabled predictive analytics together
                      with innovative sensor platforms, drones, and similar tools to monitor floods, tremors, changes in
                      the sea level, windstorms, and various natural hazards. AI-enabled predictive analysis assists the
                      governments and associated agencies in making timely decisions and early evacuation if necessary.
                      With AI, it is possible to harness using a variety of economic situations and sectors to manage
                      climate change and environmental impacts. AI utilization in environmental applications is
                      anticipated to cause major growth of the global economy by 2030. AI is anticipated to generate
                      millions of new jobs worldwide by providing highly skilled occupations as a part of the change. AI
                      allows future systems to be highly productive for nature as well as the economy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Technology for Sustainability -</strong> Besides AI, cloud technology is being
                      widely used by companies to achieve sustainability goals. Cloud computing in other words is
                      enabling greener tech transformation. Cloud providers are engaged in the design and operation of
                      sustainable and low cost workloads, as part of efforts to achieve efficiency and optimization.
                      Cloud technology is hence playing a major role in enabling brands to reduce energy usage, cut down
                      carbon emissions, and support waste reducing measures of companies. </li>
                    <li><strong>Reuse and Recycle Practice for Sustainability -</strong> Retail operations are known to
                      generate huge volumes of waste, and with e-commerce sector booming the waste generation is poised
                      to grow even further. One of the key priorities for retail sector in 2023 and beyond will be to
                      cut down packaging waste. Several companies are making efforts in this regard. For instance, Zabka
                      announced plans to make packaging recyclable by 2024. Several fast fashion brands also intend to
                      use demand planning for making precise predictions about demand for seasonal products in order to
                      address the wastage issue. Another major way to cutdown wastage is through circular economy,
                      involving reuse and recycling of materials. Several brands are using circular strategies in their
                      operations. Ikea for instance has announced commitment to become entirely circular by 2030.
                      Similar initiatives have been announced by Starbucks and McDonalds involving reusable cup
                      programs.’ </li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency of Sustainability Reporting - </strong>The emergence of several
                      environmental issues over the years will lead more companies to be held accountable for carbon
                      emissions in 2023 and beyond. Customers and stakeholders will demand more measures to be taken to
                      address wasteful practices in businesses. Among the changes being made by companies is to
                      incorporate high priority for enhanced transparency in sustainability reporting. New carbon
                      accounting standard is also helping draw in on existing standards. Other measures include
                      appointment of a chief sustainability offices and publication of transparent reports on website
                      for public. Governments are also expected to present transparency measures through climate
                      summits. </li>
